From the time that the priests enter to eat their , the heave, is the gift to the Cohen from agricultural produce ( 18:12) and also the Cohen’s part of the tithes given to the Levites from produce ( 18:26). These gifts must be eaten in ritual purity ( 18:13: “every pure person in your family may eat it.”) There are several stages in the cleansing from ritual impurity. Serious impurities (defilement by a corpse, a leper, or a sufferer from gonorrhea) need special rituals. More common defilements, such as touching a dead animal or coming in contact with a more severely impure person, need immersion in the ritual bath (). This immersion removes impurity but does not yet allow a person to touch sanctified food or to enter the Temple before nightfall, as it is said ( 22:6–7): “He may not eat of sanctified food unless he immersed himself in water. When the sun leaves he shall be purified and after that he may eat of the sanctified food.” [For the more severe kinds of impurity, a sacrifice is needed before the Cohen may eat sacred food in the Temple; this does not concern us here.] The Halakhah will discuss the exact meaning of “the sun leaving” and its relation to sunset and nightfall. Today, no Cohen may eat any and the minimal amount set apart for must be burned; it is ritually unclean from the start since nowadays everybody is defiled by the impurity of dead bodies. That impurity can be removed only by sprinkling with water treated with the ashes of the Red Heifer ( 19). The Mishnah was edited approximately between 200 and 220 C. E. It must be assumed that the rules of the Mishnah are intended to be practical. It follows that 130 years after the destruction of the Temple there were still places in Israel where the Cohanim could purify themselves by the ashes of the Red Heifer (in Galilee which was only minimally damaged by the two wars with the Romans.), until the end of the first night watch are the words of Rebbi Eliezer is accepted by everybody. Rebbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was one of the foremost students of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, the founder of the Synhedrion of Jabneh after the destruction of the Temple. He was the most conservative of all teachers of his time and reputed to transmit old traditions most reliably.. But the Sages say until midnight. Rabban Gamliel says until the first sign of dawn. It happened that his (Rabban Gamliel’s) sons returned from a wedding feast and told him: We did not recite the . He said to them: If dawn has not yet come then you are obligated to recite. Not only that, but everywhere the Sages said “until midnight”, the obligation is to the start of dawn. The obligation of burning fats and limbs on the altar [and eating of the Passover sacrifice] is until the start of dawn. 6:1). In the interpretation of the Mishnah, there is a fundamental disagreement between Rashi and Maimonides. Rashi ( 2a, להרחיק) כדי writes: “Concerning burning of the fats, the Sages did not restrict it to ‘until midnight’ at all and it is mentioned here only to emphasize that everything that has to be done in the night is the entire night.” Maimonides, in his commentary on the Mishnah, writes: “They said about all of these activities ‘until midnight’, even though there would be time until the first signs of dawn, as a ‘fence’ that no one should come to act under pressure and prolong his actions until after the start of dawn; that is what they said ‘In order to remove people from sin.’ ” And he formulates this in his code ( 4:2): “In order to avoid wilful transgression, the Sages said to bring to the altar the parts that have to be burned only until midnight.” Neither the Yerushalmi nor the Babli discuss the burning of sacrifices during the night. However, as Rebbi Ḥuna points out in the following paragraph, in his opinion the entire discussion in the Mishnah is about Rabbinic precepts, rather than Biblical commandments. This is compatible only with the point of view of Maimonides. It is a well known principle that Maimonides follows the Yerushalmi in all points in which there is no contrary opinion indicated in the Babli; he will take the silence of the Babli in this matter as an endorsement of the interpretation of the Yerushalmi. All sacrifices that can be eaten during one full day only could be eaten until the first dawn. In that case, why did the Sages say, only until midnight? In order to remove people from sin. HALAKHAH: When does one start to read the in the evening?. We have stated for Hebrew הגד “to tell formally”. It is a technical term that implies a statement of Tannaïm, the teachers of the oral law who were active from Maccabean times to the death of Rebbi Yehudah the Prince, the compiler of the Mishnah. The insistence on this being taught, or formulated, repeatedly, shows that a statement introduced by תני is a formal statement, carefully formulated for oral repetition, and not just an statement in a discussion. The vocalization תַּנִּי is the prevalent one in the Yerushalmi .: “From the time that the priests enter to eat their ”. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated is probably based on his material even though in the current form it is a Babylonian rearrangement. Now the Tosephta ( I,1) is quoted in the Babli ( 2b):מאימתי מתחילין לקרוֹת קרית שמע בערבית משעה שבני אדם נכנסין לאכוֹל פתן בערבי שבתוֹת דברי רבי מאיר וחכמים אוֹמרים משעה שהכהנים זכאין לאכוֹל בתרוּמתן. “When may one start to read the in the evening? From the time that people enter to eat their meals on Friday Evening, says Rebbi Meïr, but the Sages say from the moment that the Cohanim are allowed to eat their .” It seems that the Talmud does not indicate that R. Ḥiyya is reported here to quote the Tosephta but that there was a difference of opinion between Rebbi and Rebbi Ḥiyya about which opinion of those mentioned in the Tosephta should be accepted in the Mishnah as authoritative. There is a fundamental disagreement between the two Talmudim in the interpretation of R. Meïr’s opinion. The Babli quotes a second version of R. Meïr, “from the time that the Cohanim immerse themselves in order to eat .” Since the Cohanim have to concentrate on their status of purity between immersion and eating, in order not to touch unclean matter inadvertently, it is clear that they will immerse themselves at or shortly after sunset, when it is still clearly day and no stars are visible, and start to eat at the earliest moment which can be declared to be night. Hence, the other version of R. Meïr, that people start to eat Friday nights, must also mean an early time. Since people return from work early on Fridays, being notified of the approaching Sabbath by the sounding of trumpets (Babli 35b), they will eat early. In particular in Babylonia, where synagogues were out in the fields, Friday evening services were held so that people could return to town before the unlit roads became completely dark. In Israel, on the other hand, synagogues were in towns and often the sermon was held on Friday evening. It is told in 9(9) that R. Meïr was preaching Friday evenings and even women came to hear the sermon at that time. Hence, the Sabbath meal was late. In Israel, R. Meïr’s pronouncement was taken to indicate a very late time.: “From the time that people enter their houses Friday evening to eat their meal.” We have stated: “Their opinions are almost identical.” Come and see: “From the time that the priests enter to eat their ” is still daylight and the stars start to appear, “from the time that people enter their houses Friday evening to eat their meal” is one or two hours into the night. You want to say that the two opinions are almost identical? Rebbi Yose said: Explain it by people in hamlets who usually leave the roads when there still is some daylight because they are afraid of wild beasts. It was stated: “He who recites (the ) before that time did not fulfill his duty.” If that is so, why does one recite (the ) in the synagogue? Rebbi Yose said: one does not recite it to fulfill one’s duty but only to stand in prayer after the study of Torah are recited in full daylight. R. Yose declares that after nightfall everybody has to recite the for himself (without benedictions) to fulfill the duty of reciting the at its proper time. In contrast to , the daily prayers are not bound rigidly to their times, as will be explained later in the Talmud.. Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Jeremiah: One who is in doubt whether he said Grace after his meal or not, must say Grace, since it is written ( 8:10): “You will eat and be satiated, then you must praise the Eternal. The vocalization of the Name is unknown. The root is certainly הוה “to exist”. The form of the name indicates either or , with a meaning “Eternal” or a , meaning “Creator”. Probably it means both but for purposes of translation it is convenient to follow Mendelssohn and use the first meaning. [The so-called “scholarly” vocalization, “Creator,” is certainly false since theophorous names show that the first syllable is vocalized either or , never , and, hence, as is to be expected, the Name does not follow any normative grammatical rule.], your God”. One who who is in doubt whether he prayed or not, may not pray, against the opinion of Rebbi Yoḥanan who said: If only one would pray the whole day long, why? Because prayer is never in vain three times a day is a rabbinic obligation. The majority opinion, reported here by R. Zeïra and anonymously in 21a, is that one may not recite this prayer more than three times a day (at least on weekdays) and that, therefore, when in doubt one may not pray since rabbinic ordinances are interpreted leniently in case of doubt. The contrary opinion of Rebbi Yoḥanan is also reported in the Babylonian Talmud () but without the argument that prayer is never in vain. Rav Haï Gaon (, Responsa p. 50, Commentaries p. 26) explains that Rebbi Yoḥanan thinks that prayer, as a supplication for Divine grace and in imitation of sacrifices, can be offered as fulfillment of a vow. It follows that, in his opinion, anyone who is in doubt whether he prayed already, should declare that his prayer should be counted as obligatory if he did not pray but as a voluntary offering if he already had fulfilled his obligation. This opinion is not acceptable to the Yerushalmi; since prayer is never in vain it does not need a prior declaration. There is a practical difference between the two Talmudim since according to Rav Haï’s interpretation, someone who started praying and remembered in the middle that he already had prayed, must stop in the middle even according to Rebbi Yoḥanan, but in the Jerusalem Talmud R. Yoḥanan is explicitly on record ( 4:3) that he goes on praying since prayer is never in vain.! About one who is in doubt whether he recited (the ) or not we may hear from this: He who recites (the ) before that time did not fulfill his duty. And before that time is it not doubtful during twilight cannot be said to certainly have violated the rule that the evening must be recited in the night and his case is equivalent to the one where the person is not sure whether he had recited the already during the current evening.? This means that one who is in doubt whether he recited (the ) or not must recite again one is stringent in case of doubt it seems that it is implied that the reading of is a rabbinic institution (though it might leave in doubt the status of the first sentence or the first section.). A sign for it (nightfall) is after stars have become visible. And though there is no proof, at least there is a hint 9:2 (38d), 1:1 (27a), 1:4 (80c), 4:11 (6a), 1:4 (49a). in ( 4:15): “We were working; half of them were holding spears, from the beginning of dawn to the visibility of stars.” And it is written ( 16): “The night was for us for watch duty and daytime for work. 7:1). The second verse, missing in the Tosephta, contains the proof: Neḥemiah declares that “day was for work” and, since he had defined his working day as dawn to dusk in the preceding verse, his definition at least for “day” is “dawn to dusk”. This is only a “hint”, not a proof, since his working day was irregular.” How many stars have to appear that it should be night? Rebbi Phineas 35b), the criterion of three stars is attributed to Samuel, one of the two foremost Babylonian authorities of the first generation. This criterion is originally Babylonian since the criterion of Cohanim eating their was never applicable in Babylonia. in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Pappus: one star (visible) is certainly daylight. Two are doubtful as night. Three is certainly night. Are two doubtful? Is it not written ( 4:15): “To the visibility of stars?, ed. P. Longworth, London 1967, pp. 171–196; , Northvale NJ 1998, p. 6) that every Biblical statement must have a definite meaning. Since numbers do not have an upper bound, the only definite number indicated by a plural is 2. Hence, the plural must mean two unless it is accompanied by a description like “many”, etc. The description in the Babli is: תפסת מוּעט תפסת תפסת מרוּבה לא תפסת “If you grab the minimum you have something in your hand; if you grab more you have nothing in your hand.” It follows that Neḥemiah can talk only about two stars in his description of night.” The minimum of “stars” are two! The first one does not count. Friday night, if someone saw one star and did work (forbidden on the Sabbath), he is free from punishment. Two, he brings a trespass offering for a sin in doubt 5:17–19 for somebody who without premeditation commits an act of which he later has doubts whether it was sinful or not. By the preceding statement, at the time when exactly two stars are visible it is impossible to know whether it is day or not. The sin offering for sins committed in error is described 4:27–35.. Three, he brings a sin offering. Saturday night, if someone saw one star and did (forbidden) work, he brings a sin offering. Two, he brings a trespass offering for a sin in doubt. Three, he is free from punishment. Rebbi Yose bar Abun 35b) by R. Yose bar Zabida. The names Abun, Abba are often contracted to Bun, Ba in the Yerushalmi. investigated: If you say that two (stars) present a doubt, if someone saw two stars on Friday night, was warned, and did forbidden work, he also saw two stars on Saturday night, was warned, and did forbidden work, then it is logical to assert that if the first period was daytime the last period was also daytime and he would be guilty for the later work; if the last period was nighttime then the first period was also nighttime and he would be guilty for the first work 35b, one has to assume that the person did work the entire period during which exactly two stars were visible. Since it is not determined when exactly the changeover from Sabbath to workday occurs during this period, one has to exclude the possibility that he did the work during daytime the first time and during nighttime the second time. The first case discussed by R. Yose bar Abun deals with a criminal trial. In Jewish law, the Biblical penalties cannot be imposed unless the accused was duly warned by witnesses not to commit the crime that he was seen to start. However, such a warning must be given unconditionally. Since nobody can assert categorically that work in twilight is a Biblical prohibition on Friday night and Saturday night, R. Yose seems to assert that two conditional warnings, given in mutually exclusive circumstances which together make a certainty of the transgression, can be counted as an unconditional warning.. If someone saw two stars on Friday night and harvested about (the volume of) half a fig, in the morning he harvested about half a fig, and he saw two stars on Saturday night and harvested about half a fig, then it is logical to assert that if the first period was daytime the last period was also daytime and one would combine daytime with Saturday night and he would be guilty for his last work; if the last period was nighttime then the first period was also nighttime and one would combine daytime with Friday night and he would be guilty for his first work 10:15). Here it is understood that one uses the example of one who harvests for human consumption. Any forbidden work on the Sabbath is sinful even in the tiniest of amounts; the minimal amounts determine only whether there is a criminal liability or not. If the work was done inadvertently or the person forgot that it was Sabbath, he may bring a sin offering in the Temple as soon as the Temple will be rebuilt. However, a sin offering can only be brought if the same action, done intentionally, would have been a criminal act. Hence, no sin offering can be brought as atonement for doing less than a minimal amount of work which would qualify as criminal act. For such an action there can be no warning and the formulation of the problem also leaves out mention of due warning; one may speak here only about the obligation (or possibility) of bringing a sin-offering. It is spelled out in (5:2–4) in respect to sin offerings for transgressions by speech (by oath, or non-speech, be refusing to be a witness) that the sin offering is brought if “(he did,) and it was forgotten by him, and he remembered and was guilty.” It is taken from here that in all cases there is one sin offering for all transgressions done in one forgetting; that any realization of the forbidden action in the time in between will cause a separate sin with a separate sin offering. Hence, it is assumed here that the person in question either was not aware that the day was a Sabbath or that harvesting on the Sabbath is forbidden, without any intermediate awareness of either Sabbath or the prohibition of harvesting. It is then asserted by R. Yose bar Abun that all acts committed during one forgetting do combine, since they will all be covered by one sin-offering. The certainty of guilt on the Sabbath is then established by the same argument as in the first case under the same conditions, viz., that in both cases the action was performed exactly during the entire time that exactly two stars were visible. The practical determination of such an action is made questionable by the next action.. That means (we judge) by those stars that are not usually seen during the day. But by those stars that are usually seen during the day we do not estimate. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said: There must be three stars not counting Venus 35b reads in the statement of R. Yose bar Abun: וּבלחוּד דיתחמוּן תלתא כוֹכבים בר מן חד כוֹכבתא, this is close to our text. R. Eliezer ben Joel (Ravia, Rhineland, 12th-13th Cent., § 199) reads וּבלחוּד דיתחמוּ תלתא כוֹכבין בדמוּת חד כוֹכבתא “only that three stars should look like one star” and explains in the name of Rebbi Yehuda (either the Pious of Regensburg or Sir Leon of Paris) that three stars have to appear in a group like feet of a tripod. The same text is quoted by the 14th cent. R. Nissim Gerondi (Ran) as דדמיין לחדא כוֹכבתא “which are similar to one star” and his contemporary ( 5:4 Note 3) that three stars should be seen כמין חד כוֹכבא “in the manner of one star”, to which reading the explanation of Ravia applies well. In fact, R. Zachariah Frankel in his commentary on the Yerushalmi points out that the feminine כוֹכבתא makes sense only if it refers to Venus. A “star” in general is כוֹכבא, masculine, and it seems that the text of has been corrected by German Jewish attention to grammatical correctness. However, if we accept the reading כוֹכבתא the statement of R. Yose bar Abun is a duplication of the earlier remark that “the first star does not count.” Ran explains that the earlier statement determines the moment of nightfall from Biblical sources but that the requirement that three stars should be seen close together is a rabbinic ordinance “to add from weekday to the holy day” and, therefore, has a different status and is a legitimate addition.. Rebbi Jacob the Southerner in the name of R. Yehudah ben Pazi: One star (visible) certainly daytime. Two are night. Does he not allow for a period of doubt? He has a doubt between star and star. It was stated: All the time that the Eastern sky is red it is certainly daylight. If it became silver colored then it is dusk. If it became black, equally from zenith to horizon, then it is night 34b) has a tannaitic statement: “What is dusk? From sundown all the time that the Eastern sky is red. If the lower part turns silver colored (pale grey) but the zenith is not yet silver colored, that is dusk. If the zenith is silver colored equal to the horizon then it is night; these are the words of R. Yehudah (bar Ilaï).” This statement looks somewhat garbled and it is explained in the name of Samuel as: “From sundown all the time that the Eastern sky is red it is daytime. If the lower part turns silver colored (pale grey) but the zenith is not yet silver colored, that is dusk. If the zenith is silver colored equal to the horizon, then it is night.” The text of the Yerushalmi is from a tannaitic source and supports Samuel’s reading. However, the Yerushalmi version is clearer since when the color of the sky at the horizon is equal to that at the zenith and is darker than pale grey, it is close to being dark.. Rebbi says: (When) the moon is at its turning point, and the sphere of the sun has started to disappear and the sphere of the moon to rise, that is dusk. Rebbi Ḥanina said: When the solar sphere finishes disappearing and the lunar sphere starts to rise. Samuel has a tannaitic statement: The moon does not shine at the moment of the disappearance of the sun nor does it go down at the moment that the sun shines, ed. Chavel, Jerusalem 1964, , p. 154–251) insists that R. Ḥanina only explains Rebbi’s statement in popular terms. Since the Talmud quotes a teaching accepted by Samuel the astronomer as confirmation of R. Ḥanina’s position, it is difficult to accept that the first tradent and R. Ḥanina should have completely parallel statements.] A reasonable explanation of this section must start with a discussion of “the turning point of the moon.” Usually this is taken as the moment of the full moon, when the moon changes from increasing to decreasing. However, this interpretation is impossible since the orbit of the moon usually deviates from the ecliptic and only about every 223 months the full moon is in the ecliptic in opposition to the sun. Hence, the “turning point of the moon” is the only time when there is a possibility of a lunar eclipse and the full moon is directly opposite to the sun. R. Ḥanina and Samuel express the view of geometric astronomy, i.e., that the full moon cannot rise as long as the sun is still visible. The anonymous first tradent notes that in rare cases the refraction of the earth’s atmosphere can lead to a situation where the full moon starts to rise while the sun, geometrically below the horizon, is still visible. [In science, this phenomenon was first studied by Ibn al Haytham in the tenth Cent.; cf. R. Rashed, , Variorum: Ashgate Publ. Co., Brookfield Vt, 1992] For practical purposes, both teachers seem to agree that in the consideration of “sundown” for Sabbath observance, the influence of refraction in the atmosphere should be disregarded.. Rebbi Samuel bar Ḥiyya bar Yehudah in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: When the solar disk starts to sink and a man is standing on top of Mount Carmel, he descends and immerses himself in the ocean, ascends and eats his , one may assume that he immersed himself during daytime.. Than is, if he used a shortcut (scil. ) “short cut”. The text cannot really mean “the top of mount Carmel” since even running down in a straight line from today’s Haifa University to the shore would take about an hour. The “top of Mount Carmel” here is more likely to be at today’s “Elijah’s cave”. In the Babylonian Talmud ( 35a) the statement of R. Ḥanina is given as illustration of the notion of dusk of R. Neḥemiah mentioned here in the next section. In the interpretation of Tosaphot ( וירד), the statement means that just when the Cohen emerges from the sea then dusk starts. but when he went on the road (scil. ), “paved road, pavement”. this does not apply. What is dusk? Rebbi Tanḥuma Midrash. His simile here is also of the nature of a sermon, illustrating the opinion of R. Yose that there is no real extended dusk but only day and night with a fleeting moment in between, the blinking of an eye in the terminology of R. Yose and the splitting of a drop of blood on the tip of a sword for R. Tanḥuma. said (it is comparable) to a drop of blood on the tip of a sword. The drop splits here and there, that is dusk. What is dusk? 34b), the previous statement describing dusk as the time between the end of a reddish glow in the East to uniform dark greyness from Eastern horizon to zenith is attributed to Rebbi Yehudah (bar Ilaï), followed by the statements of R. Neḥemiah and R. Yose here, making the definition of dusk a triple disagreement. By contrast, it seems that the Yerushalmi accepts the criterion of the color of the Eastern sky as universally valid, only that Rebbi Neḥemiah qualifies it in time. The relationship between the statements of R. Neḥemiah and R. Yose is discussed in the next section. Since the standard for a normal person is to walk 10 [= 40 miles ()] in a day of 12 hours, the time allocated to a is 12/40 hours or (12×60)/40 = 18 minutes. [Maimonides counts the 10 from beginning of dawn to the end of dusk; his time for walking a is 24 minutes.] This refers to a day of 12 hours between sunrise and sunset, i.e., for the equinoxes if constant hours are used. In addition, the determination of time is valid only for the Land of Israel or other countries of the same latitude. For other latitudes, the length of dusk has to be determined by the angle of depression of the sun at the end of 9 or 12 minutes after sunset in Israel on March 21. The Babylonian Talmud ( 34b) replaces the time of ½ (Roman?) in Galilee by ⅔ Babylonian?) in Babylonia on the lower Euphrates. From after sundown the time a man needs to walk half a , the words of Rebbi Neḥemiah. Rebbi Yose said: dusk is a moment and the sages could not determine it. Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Aḥa were sitting together. Rebbi Yose said to Rebbi Aḥa: Is it not reasonable that the end of the half a of Rebbi Neḥemiah is the moment (of Rebbi Yose) 35a).? He answered: I also am of that opinion. Rebbi Ḥizqiah does not say so but every single moment in the half a of Rebbi Neḥemiah is in doubt. Rebbi Mana said: I pointed out the difficulty before Rebbi Ḥizqiah from what we have taught ( I,6): “He saw one emission during daytime and one at dusk or one at dusk and the next one the next day; if he knows that the emission at dusk was partially during daytime and partially during nighttime, he certainly is impure and needs a sacrifice but if it is questionable whether the emission occurred partially during daytime and partially during nighttime he certainly is impure but it is questionable whether he owes a sacrifice. deals with men suffering from gonorrhea or any other sexually related effluent ( 15:1–15). In the interpretation of the school of Hillel there are three stages in the uncleanness of a . If he had one episode, he is unclean but may cleanse himself by immersion in water as with any other defilement. If he had two episodes not separated by a full day, he can cleanse himself only by immersion in running water after being free of symptoms for a full seven days. If he had three episodes (again, not separated by a full day from dusk to dusk without incident) then he not only has to immerse himself in running water after seven days but he also has to bring a purifying sacrifice (if there is a Temple.) There is a standard duration that is counted as an episode and a continuous emission during a longer period is counted as two (or more, depending on length) emissions. The Mishnah here states that an episode during dusk will be counted as two even if it is relatively short if part of the episode happened during the previous day and part during the following night. Hence, the exact determination of the boundary between day and night is essential.” Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Josef asked before Rebbi Yoḥanan: Who is the Tanna who will split an emission into two? Rebbi Yose! I,12–13: “If he had one long emission such that he would have had time to immerse himself in a ritual bath and dry himself then it is counted as two episodes; shorter than that it is only counted as one. Rebbi Yose says it is always counted as only one episode. However, Rebbi Yose agrees that if he had an emission during dusk, even though its duration was not long enough for immersion and drying himself, it is counted for two since it happened on different days. In this sense did R. Yose say: If he had an emission during twilight he is possibly defiled (unclean for seven days) but not obliged to bring a sacrifice. If he had two emissions during twilight he is possibly defiled and possibly obligated to a sacrifice. If he had one emission at another (certain) time and one during twilight or one during twilight and one at another time he is certainly defiled (for seven days) and questionable for a sacrifice. If he had two emissions at other times and one at twilight or two at twilight and one at another time he is certainly defiled and certainly must bring a sacrifice.” I said to him: Here is your problem since you say that every single moment in the half a of Rebbi Neḥemiah is in doubt. What is his question good for? For the time when Elijah will come and say: that is dusk and end of Sabbath.). Who disagrees? Rebbi Ḥanina the Colleague of the Rabbis asked: Just as you say in the evening that it is night if three stars are visible even though the sun is in the middle of the sky it is night, so you must say the same thing in the morning. Rebbi Abba.) Hence, the different treatment of dawn and dusk in the Mishnah seems to contradict the principles of Rabbinic Bible interpretation. said: It is written ( 19:23): “The sun over the earth and Lot came to Zoar.” And it is written ( 22:7): “The sun will and he shall be pure.” He brackets going out and coming. Since coming means that it is hidden from the creatures so also its coming out when it will be ascertained by the creatures. Rebbi Abba said, it is written ( 44:3): “In the morning it was light.” The Torah called the light morning. Rebbi Ismael 6): “ ‘They shall eat the meat during that night’; from here I understand during the entire night. The verse says ‘do not leave any leftovers until morning; but anything left over until morning you shall burn in fire.’ Why does the verse repeat ‘until morning’? To give a domain to the earliest part of morning. From here they said ( 3–4): ‘The consumption of the Passover sacrifice and all other sacrifices, the burning of their parts on the altar can be done until the start of dawn and all sacrifices that must be eaten within one day can be eaten until the start of dawn.’ Why did the Sages decree (that all must be done) until midnight? To remove people from transgression and to make a fence around the Torah.” This is an additional indication that the earliest possible sign of dawn is the Biblical start of a new day. stated: ( 12:10) “In the morning, in the morning,” to give a domain to the very early morning. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said: If you say to give the thickness of the sky to the night both in the evening and in the morning then you must say that day and night are not of equal length; but we have stated: On the days of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, day and night have equal length. Rebbi Huna 53b) is strictly of the opinion that the twilights of dawn and dusk are of equal length.] said: We may learn from the ways of the world since if the king leaves [his palace] one already states that he left before he left but when he returns one does not say that he did return until he actually entered [the palace]. He who prepares to pray must equalize his feet 10b) brings only the opinion that in praying the prayer one has to equalize one’s feet like the angels; and this is the name of R. Yose bar Ḥanina in the name of R. Eliezer ben Jacob.. Two Amoraim, Rebbi Levi and Rebbi Simon; one of them says like angels were one straight ” However, (part 1, p. 17) quotes an opinion, possibly of Rav Hai Gaon, that the heels should be together but the toes separated to form a semicircle since the verse quoted from Ezechiel continues “the sole of their feet was like the foot sole of a calf.” and one of them says like priests. He who says like priests, ( 20:23): “You shall not ascend my alter by stairs;” that means that they were walking with their heel next to the great toe and great toe next to the heel. He who says like angels ( 1:7)” “Their feet were a straight foot.” Rebbi Ḥanina bar Andrei in the name of R. Samuel ben Soṭar: angels have no moving joints. What is the reason? ( 7:16) “I approached one of those standing,” the fixed ones 65(17), the lexical note is attributed to the slightly older authority R. Reuben: Rebbi Reuben said: It is written ( 1:25) “When they were standing their wings became limp.” Is there any sitting in heaven (that standing should be remarkable)? Does not R. Samuel say: there is no sitting in heaven since it says ( 1:7) “their feet were a straight foot.” They have no moving joints: ( 7:16) “I approached one of those standing קאמיה,” the fixed ones קיימיא. It also says ( 6:2): “Seraphim are standing over Him;” ( 18:18): “All the hosts of Heaven were standing,” and here it says “when they are standing”; this is astonishing. What really means “when they are standing” (בעמדם), it means “the people come, silence” (בא עם דם), i.e., when Israel are saying “Hear o Israel” the angels are silent and then their wings drop. is an old Yerushalmi source and one may speculate that the Midrash precedes the editing of the Talmud; otherwise it would be incomprehensible why a statement on the Amidah prayer intrudes on the discussion of the rules of .. Rebbi Huna said: He who sees the priests in the synagogue, at the first blessing he must say ( 103:20) “praise the Lord, His messengers.” At the second blessing ( 21) “praise the Lord all His hosts.” At the third blessing ( 22) “praise the Lord all His creatures.” At at the first blessing he must say ( 134:1) “A song of ascent. Praise the Lord all servants of the Lord, who are standing in the Lord’s House in the nights.” At the second blessing ( 2) “lift your hands in holiness.” At the third blessing ( 3) “May the Lord bless you from Zion.” When there are four blessings then for the third he repeats the first, for the fourth the second, the instruction on how to behave during the blessing is added here. The Babli ( 39b) gives separate verses also for days of three and four blessings and rejects the last selection of the Yerushalmi.. Rebbi Ḥinnena said: From the appearance of the “morning hind 22) denotes the zodiacal light; see the next section.” until the first rays of light in the East a man can walk four . From the first rays of light in the East until sunrise four 94a), there one speaks of עלוֹת השחר, “the coming up of the morning”. איילת השחר is not a technical term used in the Babli.. From where do we know that from the first rays of light in the East until sunrise there are four Since it is written ( 19:15) “about when the morning came etc.” And it is written ( 23) “the sun rose over the land and Lot arrived at Zoär.” From Sodom to Zoär there are four It is farther than that. 93b), Rebbi Ḥanina testifies that he checked out the distance and found it to be five . The Babli finds that the time of an average person walking five is too long for dawn but he does not try to harmonize the interpretation of the verses with the current observations of twilight. Rebbi Zeïra said: the angel was flattening in the technical sense of “levelling” by surveyors who for exact measurements use only yardsticks that are exactly horizontal. R. Zeïra wants to say that they walked only absolutely flat roads where the usual speed is higher. the road before them. And from where do we know that from the appearance of “the morning hind” until the first rays of light at the East there are four ? “About when”, “when”, compares one thing to another. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said: Anybody who identifies the “morning hind” with the planet Venus is in error; that planet sometimes is too early and sometimes too late. What is it? It is like two double horns of light that arise from the East and give light. Explanation for one another are extremely rare in Greek words coming into Aramaic. Also, no action is reported here.: The great Rebbi Ḥiyya and Rebbi Simeon ben Ḥalaphta were walking in the valley of Arbela before morning and saw “the morning hind” that started radiating. The great Rebbi Ḥiyya said to Rebbi Simeon ben Ḥalaphta, the great man: so will be the deliverance of Israel; it starts out very little and grows and longer as it goes on. What is the reason ( 7:8): “When I shall dwell in darkness, the Lord is my light.” So also at the start ( 2:21): “Mordocai was sitting at the king’s gate.” After that (6:11): “Haman took the garment and the horse.” After that (6:12): “Mordocai returned to the king’s gate.” After that (8:15): “Mordocai left the king’s presence in royal garb.” After that (8:16): “The Jews had light and joy.” The statement of Rebbi Ḥanina. In the Leyden ms. and the prints, the reference here is to R. Ḥiyya; the correct reading is in the Rome ms. and the commentary of R. Eleazar Askari. is parallel to that of Rebbi Yehudah since it was stated in the name of Rebbi Yehudah: the thickness of the sky is a walk of 50 years 6(9), it is asserted that the entire sky represents a distance of 500 years and that between each sky and the next there is a distance measured by 500 years. It is not clear how the “distance of 500 years” is meant to be computed.. An average person walks 40 during a day is 2000 cubits. Therefore, the exact length of a depends on the length of a cubit. Based on a length of 55 cm for a cubit, the would be 1100 meters. The Roman mile was 1473.2 m. A of 1100 m would give a daily trip of 27.34 English miles. Determination of the by modern Rabbinic authorities vary from 960m (Rav Naeh) to 1152m (Ḥazon Ish) and 1296m (Ḥatam Sopher). In the Babli 94a, Rava quotes a tradition that the circumference of the earth is 6000 or 24’000 mil. It is not clear at which latitude this length is computed. Based on a Greek παρασάγγης of 5.523 km, the computed 33’078 km would fit well with the circumference of the earth at about the latitude of Jerusalem or Southern Babylonia. The corresponding would be 1380 m.. Until the sun breaks through in the sky it passes the distance of 50 years; during that time a man can walk four . If follows that the thickness of the sky is one tenth [of the path of the sun] in one day. And just as the thickness of the sky is a walk of 50 years so the thickness of the earth and that of the abyss is a walk of 50 years. What is the reason? ( 40:22) “He Who thrones over the circle of the earth,” and it is written ( 22:14): “He passes by the circle of the sky.” And it is written ( 8:27) “When He carved out a circle on the face of the abyss.” “Circle” (חוּג) always has the same meaning. Is has been stated: The Tree of Life is wide a parcourse of 500 years. Rebbi Yehudah ben Rebbi Ilaï said: not only its crown but even its stem.All the splitting of primeval waters splits under it since ( 1:3) “He shall be like a tree planted on split waters.” It has been stated: The Tree of Life is one sixtieth of the Garden. ( 2:10) “And a river originated in Eden to irrigate the Garden.” The remainder of a is a triple , a sixtieth 10a. Rashi explains there that with what remains in watering vessels used for a of grain one can still irrigate three . (A is 180 .). The remainder of Africa is Egypt, a sixtieth. We find that it is said that Egypt can be traversed in 40 days. The distance is in the order of magnitude of 1000 km or about 650 miles.. Black Africa can be traversed in slightly more than seven years. But the teachers say [the sky is determined] by the days of the patriarchs ( 11:21) “like the days of the sky over the earth.” And just as the sky over the earth is at a distance of a way of 500 years so between one sky and the next is a way of 500 years and its thickness is a way of 500 years. Why did you see fit to say the thickness of the sky is a way of 500 years? Rebbi Abun said 4(1). There we read: “The rabbis say in the names of R. Ḥanina, R. Pinḥas, R. Jacob bar Abun, in the name of R. Shemuel bar Naḥman: When the Holy One, praise to Him, said: ‘there should be a spread’, the middle drop jelled and separated upper and lower waters.” After that the opinion of Rav is quoted. The opinion of R. Yehudah ben Pazi is given there by R. Yehudah bar Simon (the full name is R. Yehudah ben R. Simon ben Pazi where either “ben Pazi” is a family name or Pazi is one of R. Ḥiyya’s twin daughters, Pazi and Martha). So possibly R. Abun here is the father of R. Jacob bar Abun in the second generation of Amoraïm and not the late R. Abun. ( 1:6): “There shall exist a spread-sky within the water.” The spread-sky shall be in the middle. Rav said: the sky was wet on the first day and jelled on the second day. Rav said: “There shall exist a spread-sky”: the sky shall strengthen, the sky shall jell, the sky shall solidify, the sky shall be spread. Rebbi Yehudah ben Pazi said: The sky (רקיע) shall be made like a piece of cloth, just as it is said ( 39:3) “They stretched (וירקעו) out the gold sheets.” It has been stated in the name of Rebbi Joshua that the world was created in Nisan. Here he disagrees with the opinion of the later rabbis, discussed up to now, that the width of the sky is a parcourse of several years. In the Babylonian Talmud 15a, R. Joshua seems to oppose the opinion of Simeon ben Zoma who defines the spread between the lower (terrestrian) and the upper (heavenly) waters to be three digits; smaller measures there are only given by late Amoraïm.: the thickness of the sky is two fingers wide. The words of Rebbi Ḥanina disagree, as RebbiAḥa said in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina (37:18) “Go to spread the skies with Him; they are strong like a cast mirror.” “Go to spread”, that shows that they are made like sheet metal. I could think that they are not sturdy but the verse says “strong”. I could think that they might weaken to translates “mirror of refined metal”. The implication here seems to be from the passive participle מוצק “being cast” (or “refined”) in a timeless manner., the verse says “like a cast mirror;” at every moment they appear recast. Rebbi Yoḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. Rebbi Yoḥanan said: Usually when someone stretches the ropes of a tent, in time the ropes will loosen. But here ( 40:22) “He stretched them like a tent to sit in,” and it said ( 37:18): “they are strong.” Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said: “Usually if someone casts a vessel, in time it will rust. But here “like a cast mirror,” all the time they look like newly cast. Rebbi Azariah 12, R. Azariah explicitly objects to the opinion that everything that has generations will wilt and die, including sky and earth. His statement here seems to say that the generations of the sky are the astronomical periods and that nevertheless everything is as on the day when sky and earth were created. comments on the remark of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish ( 2:1–3) “The sky and the earth and all their hosts were completed. God finished on the Seventh Day … and God blessed the Seventh Day.” What is written after that? ( 2:4) “These are the generations of the skies.” What has one to do with the other? Only that a day comes and goes, a week comes and goes, a month comes and goes, a year comes and goes. And it is written ( 2:4) “These are the generations of the skies and the earth when they were created, on the day that the Eternal, God, created earth and heaven.” Rebbi as the first watch in the night, the discussion of the Mishnah now turns to the legal determination of the length of a nightwatch. The text here is composed of two sources. The statement about the number of watches in a night according to Rebbi and Rebbi Nathan is a Tosephta (1:1). This Tosephta also has the division of the hour and its subdivisions by 24 parts each. This seems to belong to Rebbi’s statement since this subdivision and the division of the night (and possibly the day) is Roman practice. Rebbi Nathan, a contemporary of Rebbi known as “the Babylonian”, follows a Babylonian tradition that also seems to have been the old Israelite practice since the verse from Judges speaks of one “middle watch” which is possible only if there are an odd number of watches in the night. According to Rebbi, a watch is three hours and it has been noted that R. Joshua, who allows to be recited during the first three hours of daylight, follows Rebbi in the division of the day. said: There are four watches during daytime and four at nighttime. The period is one twenty-fourth of an hour. The time is one twenty-fourth of a period. The moment is one twenty-fourth of a time. How much is a moment? Rebbi Berekhiah in the name of Rebbi Ḥelbo said: as long as one needs to pronounce it. The Sages say the moment is like the blink of an eyelash. Samuel did formulate: the moment is one in 56,848 of an hour on 2:19. 3(1)], all of which have an identical text and the definition of the number of moments in an hour by Rebbi as 24= 13824, by Samuel as 56848, and by others either as the time needed to say the word or as the blinking of an eye. In Babylonian sources ( 7a, 4a) the numbers are quoted anonymously and are given as 58888 (printed editions), 56880 (Munich manuscript), 56800 (Koronel manuscript) in and 53848 (printed editions), 56884 (R. Ḥananel), 56888 (Munich ms.) in . In the reading is 5845. The opinion that a moment is the length of time needed to pronounce the word is attributed in the Babli to Rebbi Abin (who might be identical with Rabin, a Galilean authority who escaped persecution by an emperor and became an authority in Babylonia.) Only the numbers given in the Yerushalmi tradition are composites of simple numbers; Samuel’s number is 16×11×17×19, whereas the Babylonian numbers have no decomposition into small factors. Now most of the numbers in the Babylonian sources (who have been copied and edited much more than the Yerushalmi and, therefore, are more likely to contain scribal errors) are close to Samuel’s number. One may, therefore, assume that the original number in all Talmud texts was 56848. In the Babylonian Talmud, the number given is from an anonymous Tannaïtic source which also adds: “Nobody can determine the moment exactly; only Bileam the sorcerer could do that.” In Antiquity (and the Middle Ages), all astronomical computations were done in the technique of the old Babylonians, in a number system based on subdivisions by 60. In general, divisions were executed only for numbers that have an easy reciprocal in the sexagesimal system, i.e., they are composed by factors of 60 (2, 3, 5, and their multiples). Instead of dividing, people looked up the reciprocal in a table and then multiplied. Samuel is the astronomer of most authority in the Talmud. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that his number, which is not invertible by the Babylonian method, is a good example that “nobody can exactly determine the moment” because 1/56848 is an infinite sexagesimal fraction. Hence, the comment of the Tanna, that “nobody can determine the moment exactly,” is implied in the number of Samuel and the Babylonian text is a derivative of the Yerushalmi text here.. Rebbi Nathan said three: ( 7:19) “at the start of the middle watch.” Rebbi Zeriqan and Rebbi Ammi 3b) is a shortened version of the Yerushalmi (in particular, in the Ashkenazic manuscript tradition.)] in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: The reason of Rebbi is ( 119:62): “At midnight I get up to thank You for Your just laws.” And it is written ( 119:148): “My eyes preceded night watches.” Rebbi Ḥizqiah said: Rebbi Zeriqan and Rebbi Abba, one explained the reason of Rebbi, the other the reason of Rebbi Nathan. He who explained the reason of Rebbi: “at midnight”. He who explained the reason of Rebbi Nathan ( 7:19): “at the start of the middle watch.” How does Rebbi Nathan uphold the basis of Rebbi’s reason, “at midnight”? Sometimes “at midnight,” sometimes “my eyes preceded night watches.” How is that? When David had a state dinner, “at midnight.” When he ate by himself, “my eyes preceded night watches.” In no case did dawn come and found David asleep. That is what David said ( 57:9): “Wake up, my honor, wake up, o harp and lute, I shall awake dawn.” My honor has to be awake because of the honor of my Creator. My honor counts for nothing before the honor of my Creator. I shall awake dawn, dawn will not awake me. His evil instinct was trying to seduce him and told him: David, usually dawn awakes kings and you say “I shall awake dawn!” Usually kings sleep until three hours into the day and you say “at midnight I get up!” But he answers, “for Your just laws.” What did David do? Rebbi Phineas in the name of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Menaḥem 4a. The Yerushalmi version is also found in ויהי בחצי הלילה, 13 and in 119.: He took a harp, put it on his headboard, got up at midnight and started playing on it so that his companions in the study of Torah should hear it. What were his companions in the study of Torah saying? When king David studies Torah, certainly we have to do it also! Rebbi Levi 3b. The verse quoted talks about the prophetic extasy of Elisha before king Jehoshaphat. R. Elazar Azkari explains that the verse from Kings can be taken to be parallel to 57:9 since in the latter verse the harp is also addressed directly, as a living being. said: a lute was hanging in David’s window and in the night the North wind was blowing and moving it and it was playing by itself. This refers to what is written ( 3:15): “It happened when the musical instrument was playing.” It does not say “when he played on the musical instrument” but “when the instrument was playing”; it was playing by itself. How does Rebbi uphold the basis of Rebbi Nathan’s reason, “at the start of the middle watch”? Rebbi Huna said: the end of the second and the start of the third split the night into two. Rebbi Mana said: Is this true? Does it say “watches”? No, it says “watch”! The first watch does not count since there the creatures are still awake. New Section. “But the sages say until midnight.” Rebbi Yasa 8b), Rav Yehudah says in the name of Samuel that practice follows Rabban Gamliël who allows the recital of after midnight in emergency cases. From the next “New Section” in the Yerushalmi it is clear that this is not the Israeli position; they forbid the recitation of the after midnight. The opinion of Samuel represents either the autochthonous Babylonian practice or the teaching of the Academy of Nahardea founded by Ḥananiah ben Ḥananiah, the nephew of Rebbi Joshua, at the time of the revolt of Bar Kokhba. in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Practice follows the Sages. Rebbi Yasa commanded his colleagues: if you want to study Torah then you should recite the before midnight and then study 1:2 that one interrupts everything he is doing to recite at its proper time. Hence, we may assume that all these scholars did recite in the synagogue. It was stated at the start that one reads in the synagogue, when Minḥa and Maäriv services are held together while it is still before sundown, to stand in prayer after studying words of Torah. [This Israeli practice was followed by Ashkenazic Jewry, whose ritual basically was Galilean, until the sixteenth Century as can be seen from Rashi to the first Mishnah, 235 and the glosses of R. Moshe Isserls 235. Because of the disapproval of the main commentators of and , the practice has disappeared in all Ashkenazic congregations except those of the old German rite.] The question here is whether the recitation of after nightfall is needed in order to fulfill the obligation of or whether it is needed to protect one’s sleep from evil influences. In the first case, one recites as soon as possible and then continues one’s normal activities; in the second case one may say only when one actually goes to sleep and then cannot say anything anymore before actually sleeping.. His words imply that the practice follows the Sages. His words imply that one may speak after in the morning is אמת ויציב but in the evening אמת ואמוּנה; in Israel the same version, אמת ויציב, was recited morning and evening. We find a disagreement between Rashi and his grandson Rabbenu Tam about the practice of praying Maäriv immediately after Minḥah, before sundown. According to Rashi on the Mishnah, the practice of reciting the is exclusively to start the prayer after words of Torah. Hence, the only valid recitation is in the night. According to Rabbenu Tam ( 2a), the prayers are held after , not more than 1.25 variable hours before sundown, and according to an opinion of R. Yehudah mentioned later in the Mishnah, both and are valid prayers. According to Rashi, it is possible that the original of the Jews in Israel did not imply that the benedictions before and after were recited in the synagogue and that, therefore, they had to be recited at home and could be combined with other prayers. It follows that “one may speak after אמת ויציב” can mean that one does not have to mention the praise of God for the redemption of Israel from Egypt immediately before starting the prayer. This interpretation is given by several commentators of the Yerushalmi, foremost among them R. Eleazar Askari. However, since the obligation to “connect the redemption to the ” in evening prayers is given in the name of R. Yoḥanan in the Babylonian Talmud ( 9b) it is difficult to state the opposite opinion here in the name of R. Yoḥanan.. It was stated: He who reads the in the synagogue during the morning service has fulfilled his duty; during the evening service he did not fulfill his duty, the foremost Ashkenazic authority of the early thirteenth century, writes that “I have received in tradition from Rabbenu Tam that practice does not follow any of these statements but R. Yehudah in Mishnah 4:1.”. What is the difference between him who reads in the morning and him who reads in the evening? (#1, vol. 1, p.5) and in (4[9]) do not contain the sentence. Rebbi Huna in the name of Rav Joseph: Why did they say, a man has to read the in his house in the evening? In order to make evil spirits flee. His words imply that one may not speak after . The words of Rebbi Samuel ben Naḥmani say the same. When R. Samuel ben Naḥmani descended for the intercalation, he was received by Rebbi Jacob the groats miller. Rebbi Zeïra was hiding among the crates to hear how he read [the ]; he read it over and over again until he drifted away in sleep. What is the reason? Rebbi Aḥa and his father-in-law Rebbi Taḥlifa in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥmani ( 4:5): “Tremble, do not sin, talk in your hearts on your couches and be silent, Selah.”’s notes in 239,1, as noted by the Gaon of Wilna. The behavior of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi2:1). It follows that his way of reading the nightly , which is the one followed today, is the oldest. In the Babylonian Talmud ( 4b) he is only reported to have stated the duty to read the before sleeping, with the reason of R. Samuel ben Naḥmani given by a Galilean Amora by the name of R. Yose or R. Assi. The psalms read by R. Joshua ben Levi are detailed in Babli 15b where it is noted that, while it is forbidden to use Biblical verses as charms in healing, it is admissible to recite them for protection. disagrees since Rebbi Joshua ben Levi read psalms afterwards. But have we not stated: One does not say words after ? He explains that as relating to of the morning prayers” mean any insertion between the benediction גאל ישׂראל and the prayer. It does not follow that the expression must have the same meaning in the preceding section., since Rebbi Zeïra said in the name of Rav Abba bar Jeremiah 42a) in the name of Rav.: There are three immediacies: immediately after leaning comes slaughtering, immediately after hand-washing comes benediction 52b to the School of Shammai; this interpretation of the Yerushalmi is implied by R. Aqiba Eiger in his notes to Babli 42a.] In the Babli, 42a, the same expression means that immediately after washing one’s hands the meal one has to say Grace and is not allowed to eat anymore., immediately after redemption comes prayer prayer. This creates no problems in the morning prayers but is impossible in the evening since after the benediction (starting or ) there follows at least one more benediction and a to separate the recital of and its benedictions, an unconditional obligation at least from the institutions of the Men of the Great Assembly, and the prayer that in the night is of conditional Rabbinical character. When the principle “immediately after redemption comes prayer” was adopted also for the evening prayers (see preceding section), the intermediate pieces were declared to be “extensions of the thanksgiving for redemption.” The benediction immediately preceding the was fixed by Babylonian Geonim to be a benediction for future redemption. The itself may be a Gaonic institution.. Immediately after leaning comes slaughtering: “He shall lean … he shall slaughter” ( 1:4–5). Immediately after hand-washing comes benediction, ( 134:2) “Lift your hands in holiness and bless the Lord.” Immediately after redemption comes prayer, ( 19:15) “May the words of my mouth be for goodwill” and it is written after that ( 20:2) “May the Lord answer you on the day of worry.””. The next psalm, disregarding the title “For the director, a psalm of David,” starts: “May the Lord answer you on the day of worry.” Since psalms in ancient manuscripts were written without paragraph divisions, the description of God as redeemer and the mention of help through prayer are consecutive. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said: For anyone who immediately slaughters after leaning, no disqualification will appear regarding his sacrifice. For anyone who immediately pronounces the benediction after washing his hands, Satan will not find anything to accuse about at that meal. For anyone who immediately prays after mentioning redemption, Satan will not find anything to accuse him of the entire day 9b), in the name of the holy congregation of Jerusalem, i.e., the Tanna R. Yose ben Hammeshullam. To it is appended the story about Rebbi Zera (Zeïra)’s complaint, only there he had to bring myrrh to the king himself. Since R. Zeïra was a Babylonian immigrant to Israel, it is not clear whether his forced labor occurred in Babylonia, on the occasion of a visit of the Persian king, or in Galilee where he only had the opportunity to see the interior of the governor’s residence. The language of the story in the Yerushalmi points to its happening in Israel, while the language of the Babli points to the Persian empire. It cannot be decided where the incident happened.. Rebbi Zeïra said, I am used to immediately pray after mentioning redemption and I was conscripted to forced labor, to bring myrrh to the Palace. They said to him: our teacher, that is an honor. There are people who pay money to see the inside of the Palace. Rebbi Immi 4b. said: Anyone who does not immediately pray after mentioning redemption, whom is he to be likened to? To an acquaintance of the king who comes from afar to the king’s door. When the king comes to see what he wants, he finds that the person left. Hence, the king also leaves. New Section. “Rabban Gamliel says until the first sign of dawn.” The statement of Rabban Gamliel is parallel to that of Rebbi Simeon, as we have stated in the name of Rebbi Simeon 8b), the statement occurs in two versions, either “sometimes a person reads the twice during the night”, or “sometimes a person reads the twice during the day” and there they have to explain that either the few minutes before the start of dawn are already counted as day because some people already get up or that the first minutes of dawn are counted as night because most people still are asleep. The statement in its Babylonian form is also in the Tosephta ( 1:1); in general, our Tosephta seems to be a Babylonian version. The Yerushalmi version avoids the ambiguity but in parallel to the Babli one has to assume that R. Simeon accepts that one may read twice within the span of a few minutes and fulfill two distinct obligations by the readings.: “Sometimes a person reads the [twice], once before dawn and once at dawn, and has fulfilled his obligation for day and night.” Hence Rabban Gamliel is like Rebbi Simeon for evening prayers, is he also like him in the morning? His position might be that expressed by Rebbi Zeïra the Tanna, the brother of Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi, and of Rav Abba bar Ḥana in the Babli 37b. It seems to be a Tosephta from the collection of the Academy of Rav.: He who reads with the men of the did not fulfill his duty because they were too early were the priests who kept watch during the night at the Temple service. Since the Temple service started at the first signs of dawn, the men of the [and the laymen accompanying them, the ], had to their prayers before the start of service, i. e., before the first sign of dawn. The Yerushalmi does not try to answer the question raised, whether Rabban Gamliel and Rebbi Simeon are of the same opinion for morning prayers, since it already had decided in the preceding section that the practice follows the Sages and, therefore, one may not recite the after midnight. Hence, the opinions of both Rebbi Simeon and Rabban Gamliel are of purely theoretical interest and no answer is required. In the Babli, the quote from Rebbi Simeon is given as a support to their decision that practice follows Rabban Gamliel. It seems to be the position of the Yerushalmi that in Temple times practice followed Rabban Gamliel in the Temple precinct and the Sages everywhere else.. Rabban Gamliel disagrees with the Sages and acts upon his opinion? 23:2) “to yield to the majority”, a religious authority is not allowed to act upon his personal opinion if it disagrees with the majority. This principle is then illustrated by several examples. It therefore is a big question why Rabban Gamliel’s action is mentioned in the Mishnah without a disapproving remark. [The position of the Babli here is quite different: Since the action of Rabban Gamliel is mentioned in the Mishnah without a disapproving remark, it follows that general practice follows Rabban Gamliel since the practice of a religious authority overrides theoretical arguments.] Did not Rebbi Meïr disagree with the Sages and not act upon his opinion, did not Rebbi Aqiba disagree with the Sages and not act upon his opinion? So we find that Rebbi Meïr disagreed with the Sages and did not act upon his opinion. We have stated: One rubs “sweet smelling things” (E. G.). There are at least two kinds, one mixture used for medical purposes, and one, mentioned in Halakhah 6:6, to be used as air freshener in a house. The Babli ( 140a) defines medical אלונתית as a mixture of wine, olive oil, and balsamum, used to reduce fever. [Brill derives the Hebrew word from Latin (), an ointment made with a base of olive oil. Jastrow (followed by Krauss, Löw, and Lieberman) derives the word from Greek οἰνάνθη, οἰ̓νανθίς, Latin , which however means only “bloom of the wild grape” and clearly is inapplicable here.] The entire quote is from 13 where it belongs to a sequence of statements that one may not use edibles for medicinal purposes on the Sabbath except if used also as food. For example, for a toothache it is possible to rinse the tooth with vinegar on condition that the vinegar then be swallowed; it is not admissible to spit out the vinegar after use. Hence, it is not allowed to mix wine and oil with balsamum on the Sabbath since that would make it inedible. The parallel quote in the Babli is 134a; the only difference in the texts is that the Babli and Tosephta have a purely Hebrew text while the Yerushalmi has the connecting remarks in Aramaic. on a sick person on the Sabbath; but only if it was mixed with oil and wine before Sabbath eve. But if he did not mix it before Sabbath eve it is forbidden. We have stated: Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar said: Rebbi Meïr did allow to mix wine and oil and to rub it onto a sick persion on Sabbath. When he fell sick, we wanted to prepare the same for him but he did not let us do it. We said to him: Our teacher, are you going to invalidate your words when your life is in danger? He said to us: even though I am lenient for others, I am stringent for myself because my colleagues disagree with me. So we find that Rebbi Aqiba disagreed with the Sages and did not act upon his opinion. As we have stated there ( 2:6): “Spine and skull from two dead bodies, a limb composed of limbs of two dead bodies, limbs taken from two living persons, Rebbi Aqiba declares them to be impure and the Sages declare them to be pure.” 2:1. Flesh is causing impurity down to the volume of an olive but bones do so only if they are either the volume of a quarter (about .55 liter), most of the bones composing the skeleton in number or in importance, or skull and/or spine. [Whether one has to read שדרה וגלגולת as “skull spine” or “skull spine” is discussed inconclusively in 52b ff.] We have stated: 4:2; there the full name Theodoros is given to the chief surgeon. The Tosephta starts: “Rebbi Yehudah said: Six cases did Rebbi Aqiba declare impure and he changed his opinion; it happened …”, and ends: “Rebbi Simeon said: Until the time of his death did Rebbi Aqiba maintain that it should be impure; whether he changed his opinion when dying I do not know.” This means that according to Rebbi Yehudah, the vote at Lod showed that Rebbi Aqiba changed his opinion but, according to Rebbi Simeon, Rebbi Aqiba did not change his opinion, only he did not want openly to defy the opinion of the majority. We assume that the Yerushalmi here accepts the opinion of Rebbi Simeon, otherwise there is no proof here. It follows that also when the Yerushalmi quotes the Tosephta, sometimes the proof comes from the omitted parts. “It happened that they brought a chest full of bones from Kefar Tabi to Lod and deposited it in the open air [the courtyard] of the synagogue. Theodoros the physician entered and with him all physicians. Theodoros declared that there was no complete spine from one dead person and no complete skull from one dead person. They said: Since we have here some who declare this pure and others who declare it impure, let us vote upon it. They started with Rebbi Aqiba and he declared it to be pure. They said: Since you had declared it impure, but now you vote for it to be pure, it is pure.” So we find that Rebbi Simeon disagreed with the Sages and did not act upon his opinion. As we have stated there ( 9:1) “Rebbi Simeon says: all aftergrowth is allowed except the aftergrowth of cabbage because nothing similar grows wild, a Jew who cannot be trusted with the careful fulfillment of all his religious obligations. The Torah says not only that it is forbidden to plant and sow during the Sabbatical year but also ( 32:5): “Do not harvest the aftergrowth of your harvest,” i. e., it is forbidden to commercially exploit the produce growing on one’s field from the seeds of the preceding year. It is, however, acceptable to collect from one’s fields small amounts for one’s daily needs (and even for storage as long as wild animals can find similar food on the fields.) Rebbi Simeon is of the opinion that a poor person may offer anything for sale since he might (or probably did) collect them from wild growing plants which do not fall under the prohibition. The only exception is produce which is never found growing wild; such vegetables are forbidden for commerce in the production of one’s own field. The Sages, while agreeing that Rebbi Simeon’s position is the one which follows the Biblical precept closely, nevertheless as a Rabbinic ordinance forbid any such buying from untrustworthy people since it is too difficult to enforce the fine distinction made by Rebbi Simeon. Our example shows that Rebbi Simeon refrained from disagreeing in practice from the rest of the Sages even in purely Rabbinical ordinances. The man cursed by him probably did collect wild aftergrowth, or maybe was known to Rebbi Simeon as a landless person who, therefore, collected from growth on other people’s land that was declared ownerless (הפקר), otherwise his opponent could not have invoked R. Simeon’s own ruling. [This explanation follows Maimonides on the Mishnah. Babli 51b has a different text, see the discussion in Mishnah 9:1, and , Halakhah 1:9, and the notes to the Mishnah edition of the Institute for the Complete Israeli Talmud, 9:1. The Rome ms. has here “forbidden,” influenced by the Babli.]. But the Sages say that all aftergrowth is forbidden.” Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai acted on this in a Sabbatical year. He saw a man harvesting aftergrowth. He said to him: Is that not forbidden, is that not aftergrowth? The man answered him back: Are you not the one who allows it? He retorted: Do not my colleagues disagree with me? He recited over him ( 10:6): “He who breaches a fence may be bitten by a snake”, and this is what happened to that man. And Rabban Gamliel disagreed with the Sages and did act on his own opinion! There is a difference here since the recitiation of the is for study. But then they could have read also after the start of dawn; the question seems to be whether it is preferable to read the twice if one forgot to recite it in the preceding period.] The question remains unanswered but this cannot be taken as rejection of the explanation.. Some want to say that in the other cases it was possible to uphold the words of the Sages. But here it was after midnight and they could no longer fulfill the precept of the Sages; so he told his sons to act according to his opinion. We have stated “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”. Some people do not formulate “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”. Who formulates “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”? The Sages. Who does not formulate “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”? Rebbi Eliezer. 9a], there is a Biblical prohibition of celebrating the Exodus after midnight. (Cf. the discussion in the author’s , Northvale NJ 1995, pp. 263–264.) Rebbi Eliezer’s argument goes as follows: The Bible prescribes that the Passover sacrifice should be eaten “in that night.” It also reports that the death of the Egyptian firstborn was “in the middle of the night”. Since the second occurrence of “night” is qualified by “middle” but the first is left indeterminate, and we subscribe to the opinion that, unless explicitly given otherwise, words in the Pentateuch have an invariable meaning, the first occurrence must also mean “midnight.” The Sages follow Rebbi Aqiba in pointing out that the first Passover had to be eaten “in a hurry”, the hurry of the Exodus that happened only the following day. Hence, the notion of “night” here is opposed to “day” and not restricted to the first half. What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? It is written here ( 12:8) “in the night”, and it is written there ( 12:29) “in the night”. Just as there it means midnight, so also here it means midnight. Rebbi Ḥuna and in (37d), the prohibitions mentioned in the Mishnah are Rabbinical. But the Babli in both cases ( 9a, 120b) refers only to the opinions of Rebbis Eliezer and Eleazar ben Azariah that the prohibition is Biblical. says: “The eating of the Passover sacrifice” cannot be here even for the Sages since we have stated ( 10:9) “the Passover sacrifice after midnight makes one’s hands impure.” at the end of his votary period when he cut his hair. Hence, “holiest of holies” sacrifices are covered by our Mishnah but only a minority of “simple sacrifices”. There might be some justification for the reading “simple sacrifices” referring to the obligation of laity only who never ate “holiest of holies”; but then no special determination would be necessary. “All sacrifices that can be eaten during one full day only,” these are the holiest of holies. at the end of his votary period when he cut his hair. Hence, “holiest of holies” sacrifices are covered by our Mishnah but only a minority of “simple sacrifices”. There might be some justification for the reading “simple sacrifices” referring to the obligation of laity only who never ate “holiest of holies”; but then no special determination would be necessary. “In that case, why did the Sages say, etc.?” If you would say until the start of dawn, one might think that dawn did not yet start and it would turn out that he eats in sin. When you say to him: “only until midnight,” even if he does eat after midnight he will not incur guilt.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: From when on does one read the in the morning? From when one can distinguish between dark blue as a color obtained by dying with the blood of some marine snail but since the snail has not been clearly identified, the color cannot be established by experimentation. From the second paragraph in the Halakhah, it would seem that תכלת could also be green, like color of the sea or like grasses. Since both in Babli ( 17a, 35b, 89a, 115) and in Yerushalmi (here, 14) sources the final comparison is with the sky, in modern Hebrew תכלת means “sky-blue” in contrast to כָּחוֹל “dark blue, color of ”. The old Greek Septuagint translation gives ὑάκινθος “hyacinth, a blue stone, perhaps aquamarine; also a blue flower.” Ashkenazic tradition has the color of תכלת as almost black since the stripes of our prayer shawls that symbolize the unavailable תכלת stripes of the , are traditionally dyed black. Hence the chosen translation of “dark blue”. and white; Rebbi Eliezer says, between dark blue and the color of leeks; (he may read it) to . For its meaning, I am following here Rabbenu Saadiah Gaon and Rabbenu Tam who admit לגמוֹר אח ההלל, “to read the Hallel”, as benediction of the Ḥazan even if only half the Hallel is recited. until sunrise. Rebbi Yehoshua says, until three hours of the day since it is the rule of (sons of) kings to rise at three hours. He who reads after that did not lose, he is like a man reading in the Torah. HALAKHAH: So is the Mishnah: Between its, dealing with the obligation of , was in Israel recited in abridged form during evening prayers. Hence, the characterized the morning prayers. Each contained three strands of white thread with one of . dark blue and its white. What is the reason of the Rabbis? ( 15:39) “You shall see it”., from what is close to it. What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? “You shall see it”, that it should be recognizable among colors. We have stated in the name of Rebbi Meïr: It does not say “you shall see it”. but “you shall see Him”. This tells you that anyone who keeps the obligation of is as if he were admitted to the presence of God’s glory. This tells that is similar to the sea. But the sea is similar to grasses, grasses are similar to the sky, the sky is similar to the Throne of Glory, and the Throne is similar to sapphire to the Throne of Glory, and the verse from Ezechiel provides the characterization as similar to sapphire., as it is written ( 10:1): “I saw, and here by the spread that was on top of the Cherubim like sapphire stone, the looks of the form of the Throne.” Others say: “ ‘You shall see it’, that a man should be four (cubit) has not been definitely established; it is between 18 and 24 inches. It is uncertain whether the Galilean and Babylonian were the same measurements. distant from another man and recognize him.” Rav Ḥisda says: (the practice follows) the statement of “Others”. What are we talking about? If he knows the other person, even at a great distance he will recognize him. If he does not know him, even close by he will not recognize him. We must talk about an occasional acquaintance, like a man who visits a hostelry at intervals. Some Tannaïm formulate: “Between wolf and dog, between domesticated and wild donkey.”. In the Babli (9b), the first criterion is given by Rebbi Meïr, the second one by Rebbi Aqiba, and both are given independently of the Mishnah. In the Yerushalmi, no names are attached since both opinions are identified as alternatives “between dark blue and leek colored”, which is not the practice anyway. “Others” (אחרים) usually denotes Rebbi Meïr. In the Babli, the problem remains that the statement attributed to “Others” cannot belong to Rebbi Meïr. However, in the Yerushalmi it may well be that “between wolf and dog” is Rebbi Meïr’s restatement of Rebbi Eliezer’s criterion in the Mishnah, and “to recognize at 4 ” the same authority’s restatement of the criterion of the First Tanna in the Mishnah. But some Tannaïm formulate: “That a man should be four distant from another man and recognize him”. That is what we have (R. Moshe Margalit) reads הוּא בָּעֵי מֵימַר “he (Rav Ḥisda, mentioned earlier) wants to say.” Then the entire statement is tentative, and רב חסדא אמר will simply mean “Rav Ḥisda said”, not as an authoritative statement. However, the commentary (R. Moshe ben Ḥabib) reads הווּן בּעי מימר “they (or we) want to say.” to say that he who says between wolf and dog, between domesticated and wild donkey is parallel to him who says between dark blue and the color of leeks; he who says that a man should be four distant from another man and recognize him is parallel to him who says between dark blue and white. But they said that its preferred obligation is at sunrise so that one may join the mention of redemption to prayer and pray at daytime as soon as one recognizes a person at a distance of 4 . Hence, “they said” refers to those who adopt the criterion mentioned last. If one recites the slowly at sunrise and then says the benediction of , he will just say the prayer when the sun is clearly above the horizon and it is visibly day.. Rebbi Zeïra said: I found the reason ( 72:5): “They will fear You with the sun.” is “acceptance of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven”, this is in essence fear of God, and, hence, the verse refers to the reading of and not the prayer. It is clear that the prayer to be performed preferably at sunrise is the recitation of Mar Uqba, the Davidic ruler of the Jews in Babylonia, in the first generation of Amoraïm. It is interesting to note that this statement of the Babylonian Mar Uqba is reported in the Babli (9b) in the name of the later Rebbi Yoḥanan. Maybe each Talmud wanted to ascribe the deeds of ותיקין to an external source, not to be held to their standards, as explained in the next section. The explanation of ותיק has been given by A. Kohut in his ערוּך השלם, from the Arabic וַתִ֗ק “to have confidence, faith”. As explained by the Babylonian Talmud, they had faith in God that all the time spent in His service would not detract from their ability to earn a livelihood, and so they were rewarded with earning enough money for their needs in the time left over after religious services and deeds. said: The very religious were getting up early and reading the ‘ so that they could follow it directly at sunrise with the prayer. We have stated 1:3; there R. Aqiba (who was the greater scholar) is mentioned before R. Eleazar ben Azariah (the vice president of the Synhedrion), and it is spelled out that they were occupied to attend to some public needs. We have a principle that he who is fulfilling a religious duty is free from engaging in any conflicting religious duty. The two sages therefore would have had the possibility of not reciting at all. The fact that they recited the shows that they considered the obligation of this recitation in full force until the end of the third hour and that, therefore, their prior occupation did not reduce the later obligation. This is explained more thoroughly in the next section. It seems that the text of the Yerushalmi is superior to the Tosephta since the vice president has precedence over a simple member and the mention of their being engaged in religious obligations is more to the point.: Rebbi Yehudah said: It happened that once I was walking behind Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah and Rebbi Aqiba when they were occupied with duties and time came to recite the and I got the opinion that maybe they had given up on reciting the , so I recited it and went over my studies; but after that they started and the sun was already over the mountain tops. “Until sunrise.” Rebbi Zabida the son of Rebbi Jacob bar Zabdi in the name of Rebbi Jonah: until the sun starts to appear at the mountain tops. “Rebbi Joshua says, until three hours of the day.” Rebbi Idi, Rav Hamnuna, and Rav Ada bar Aḥava. The name mentioned in the printed editions, אדא בר אחא, is not mentioned again in any Talmudic source. Rav Ada bar Aḥawa (Yerushalmi) is called Rav Ada bar Ahavah in the Babli; all teachers quoted here are students of Rav. In the Babli (10b), Rav Yehudah says in the name of Samuel: the practice follows Rebbi Joshua, without qualifications. It seems that in Israel one was reluctant to give up the recitation of the at sunrise but in Babylonia the practice of very early prayers was never established. in the name of Rav: The practice follows Rebbi Joshua for one who forgets. Rebbi Ḥuna told of two Amoraïm of whom one said ‘for one who forgot.’ His colleague responded: Do you ever fix practice for one who forgets? In fact, it is the practice. Why did they say, for one who forgot? That everybody should make an effort and read it at its best time. There ( 1:2) we have stated: “One interrupts for the recitation of but one does not interrupt for prayer.” 9b. Of those who give the reasons for the difference in the treatment of and , Rebbis Aḥa and Yose belong to the fourth generation of Amoraïm in Israel, hence Rebbi Abba will also belong to that group. [There were too many Amoraïm by the name of Rebbi Abba to clearly distinguish between them.] The entire section here and the following one also appear in Yerushalmi 1:2. Rebbi Aḥa said: The recitation of ‘ is a Biblical obligation; prayer is not a Biblical obligation is Biblical, at least for the first verse [following the Babli (, #320)] or the first three verses [following the Yerushalmi, as seen here]. There is disagreement on the status of prayer. The Yerushalmi at the beginning of Chapter 4 follows the in the interpretation of the “service of the heart” mentioned in 10:12, 11:13 as prayer, which, therefore, is Biblical. Rebbi Aḥa does not accept this derivation; similarly, the Babli ( 21a) declares prayer to be a Rabbinical obligation.. Rebbi Abba said: The time for the recitation of the is fixed, the time for prayer is not fixed. 1:1) who writes: “It is a positive commandment that one should pray every day as it is said: ‘you shall serve the Eternal, your God.’ Tradition teaches us that this service is prayer, as it is said: ‘to serve Him with all your heart’; the sages explain that the service of the heart is prayer. But the number of prayers is not from the Torah, neither is the formulation of the prayer from the Torah. Prayer has no fixed time from the Torah.” [Everybody agrees that the obligation of offering prayer three times a day is historical ( 6:11) and the form of prayer is an institution of the Men of the Great Assembly.] This interpretation of the disagreement between Rebbis Aḥa and Abba is given by the great Sephardic commentators, Rabbis Eleazar Azkari and Moshe ben Ḥabib. There is a different interpretation possible, namely that Rebbi Abba wants to state that the time of is narrowly fixed, as we have seen, and once that time is passed, the omission cannot be repaired. For prayer, however, the rules are much more elastic. First, there is much more time given for the recitation; then it is possible to pray in advance of the time (as in the evening prayers held before sundown), and a missed prayer can be compensated for by praying the next time twice. Hence, in a real sense, even prayer in the Rabbinical sense has no fixed time compared to . Rebbi Yose said: The recitation of does not need concentration, prayer needs concentration. 1:1) who writes: “It is a positive commandment that one should pray every day as it is said: ‘you shall serve the Eternal, your God.’ Tradition teaches us that this service is prayer, as it is said: ‘to serve Him with all your heart’; the sages explain that the service of the heart is prayer. But the number of prayers is not from the Torah, neither is the formulation of the prayer from the Torah. Prayer has no fixed time from the Torah.” [Everybody agrees that the obligation of offering prayer three times a day is historical ( 6:11) and the form of prayer is an institution of the Men of the Great Assembly.] This interpretation of the disagreement between Rebbis Aḥa and Abba is given by the great Sephardic commentators, Rabbis Eleazar Azkari and Moshe ben Ḥabib. There is a different interpretation possible, namely that Rebbi Abba wants to state that the time of is narrowly fixed, as we have seen, and once that time is passed, the omission cannot be repaired. For prayer, however, the rules are much more elastic. First, there is much more time given for the recitation; then it is possible to pray in advance of the time (as in the evening prayers held before sundown), and a missed prayer can be compensated for by praying the next time twice. Hence, in a real sense, even prayer in the Rabbinical sense has no fixed time compared to . Rebbi Mana said: I objected before Rebbi Yose: Even if you say that the recitation of the does not need concentration, the first three verses need concentration. Since they are so few, one will concentrate upon their meaning. Rebbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai: “For example we, who are engaged in the study of Torah, we do not interrupt even for the recitation of .” Rebbi Yoḥanan used to say about himself: “For example we, who are not engaged in the study of Torah, we do interrupt even for prayer.” This one follows his own opinion and that one follows his own opinion. Rebbi Yoḥanan follows his own opinion since Rebbi Yoḥanan says: “if only a man would pray the entire day. Why? Because prayer is never in vain!” Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai follows his own opinion since Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai said: “If I had stood at Mount Sinai at the moment that the Torah was given to Israel, I would have implored the All-Merciful that he should create two mouths for man; one for him to exert himself in Torah and the other one for his other needs.” But he changed his mind and said: “With one mouth already the world almost cannot exist because of its denunciations, , , adj. to , in late Latin “accusation, information, denunciation,” the act of a , “government informer.” Because of an informer about his anti-Roman feelings, Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai and his son had to spend 12 years hidden in a cave (Babli 33b, Yerushalmi 9:1, fol. 38d). When he left the cave, he was so upset that people would engage in farming and commerce and not study Torah all day long that a heavenly voice ordered him back to his cave for another 12 months in order to get used to the world again. Both Talmudim consider his position appropriate only for exceedingly holy people.; if there were two how much more would there be? Rebbi Yose said before Rebbi Jeremiah: The position of Rebbi Yoḥanan is identical with that of Rebbi Ḥanina ben Aqabiah, as we have stated: “The scribes of Torah scrolls, , and , do interrupt for the recitation of but do not interrupt for prayer. Rebbi Ḥanina ben Aqabiah said: just as they interrupt for , so they interrupt for prayer, , and all other commandments of the Torah”. 2:6, cf. also Babli 26a. The Tosephta also brings the opinion of Rebbi, that they do not interrupt for , and a testimony that Rabban Gamliel and the Synhedrion at Yavneh did not interrupt sessions dealing with communal matters. Would not Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai agree that one interrupts to make a or a ? Does not Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai make the distinction between one who studies in order to do and one who studies in order not to do? Because he who studies in order not to do would have been better off had he not been born. And did not Rebbi Yoḥanan say, he who studies in order not to do would have been better off if the afterbirth he was in was twisted around and he never would have entered the world? The reason of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai is that this one is repeated study and that one is repeated study and he does not push aside one study for the other study. recite since its recitation was replaced by his studies, but he pray, even though the Mishnah seems to indicate that one omits prayer more easily than . But did we not formulate:. “He is like a man reading in the Torah.” Hence, at the right time it is preferred to Torah. One is like the other. Rebbi Yudan said that Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai, since he was permanently studying Torah, did not prefer to the study of Torah. Rebbi Abba Mari said, did we not formulate: “He who reads () after that did not lose, he is only like a man reading in the Torah”? Hence, at the right time it is like Mishnah. Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai follows his own opinion since Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai said: He who studies the written Torah does himself good that is not so good. But the rabbis equate the study of the Bible with that of the oral law. in its proper time transcends both for everybody including scholars of the rank of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai. Mishnah here stands for the entire Oral Law, which was called Mishnah in the time of Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai. (See the parallel in Babli 33a.)",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: The school of Shammai say: In the evening, everyone must bend down since, as a technical term, it is used only for formal recitation of Biblical texts. and recite and in the morning they should stand up since it is said ( 6:7): “when you sit in your house or go on the road, when you are lying down and when you are getting up.” But the school of Hillel say: everyone should recite in the position he is in, since it says “or go on the road.” In that case, why does it say: “when you are lying down and when you are getting up;” this means the time when people go to sleep and the time when they are getting up. HALAKHAH: They of the school of Hillel are able to explain both parts of the verse. How do those of the school of Shammai explain “when you sit in your house or go on the road”? “When you sit in your house”, to exclude those who are occupied with other religious commandments, “or go on the road” to exclude bridegrooms. 11a. The bride is exempt from reciting the since women are freed from all positive commandments which have to be performed at set times. The bridegroom himself fulfills a divine commandment by getting married, but that fulfillment is really restricted to the short act of actual marriage and then to the first married intercourse; the exemption of the bridegroom from saying refers to the entire wedding feast when he is unable to concentrate even on the first verses. We have stated 11a, 1:4, 34), R. Eleazar ben Azariah at first is sitting up and R. Ismael is reclining. This means that in the Babylonian version, the discussion was in the evening (also indicated in the Babylonian Talmud by a change in language, not “that they stayed at the same place” but that “they had dinner together.”) In our version, the discussion takes place in the morning. While R. Ismael, after R. Aqiba the greatest scholar of his generation, did certainly exceed R. Eleazar ben Azariah in scholarship, the latter was the vice president of the Synhedrion; it is more likely that R. Ismael was sitting upright at the start. They might have got up very early, before the start of dawn, when it still was possible to eat before praying. It is impossible to decide which of the two versions is the original.: It happened that Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah and Rebbi Ismael stayed at the same place and Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah was reclining while Rebbi Ismael was standing. When the time for the recital of the arrived did Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah stand and Rebbi Ismael reclined. Rebbi Eleazar said to Rebbi Ismael, this is as when one says to someone in the market place, your beard is overgrown, and he says, that is against those who shave. I, who was reclining, stood up and you, who were standing, went on to recline. He answered him: You stood up following the school of Shammai, I reclined following the school of Hillel. Another explanation: That the students should not see me and make it the permanent practice to follow the school of Shammai.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Rebbi Ṭarphon said: I was on the road and reclined to recite the following the school of Shammai. There I put myself in danger because of the robbers. They told him: It would have served you right to be in mortal danger since you transgressed the words of the school of Hillel. HALAKHAH: In the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan 2:5 (fol. 41c) where 1:2, “May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth since your friendship is better than wine”, is discussed. In the transcription here, the first word fell out. It should read: The fellows (of the Yeshivah) in the name of R. Yoḥanan. In traditional interpretation, the Song of Songs is a dialogue between God and the people of Israel (represented by the girl); the question of the Mishnah was whether one reads דּוֹדָיִךְ (feminine) or דּוֹדֶיךָ (masculine) for “your friendship, your relations.”: The words of the scribes are related to the words of Scripture and are pleasant like the words of Scripture. ( 7:10) “Your throat is like the good wine”; Simeon ben Abba in the name of R. Yoḥanan: The words of the scribes are related to the words of Scripture and are more pleasant than the words of Scripture. ( 1:2) “Since your friendship is better than wine”; Rebbi Abba bar Cohen in the name of Rebbi Judah ben Pazi: You can know that the words of the scribes are more pleasant than those of Scripture because if Rebbi Tarphon did not recite at all he would have transgressed only a positive commandment. But because he transgressed the words of the school of Hillel he should have suffered death since it says: ( 10:8) “He who breaches a fence will be bitten by a snake.” Rebbi Ismael did formulate: In the Torah there are forbidden matters and permitted matters. There are easy parts and severe parts. But in the words of the Sages all are severe, the men of the Great Assembly headed by Ezra and their successors before the period of the Rabbis, to be more restrictive than the original precepts of the Torah.. You can realize that this is so since we have stated (Mishnah 11:5): “If he 10:5. The interpretation of the law is much more restrictive in the Babli than in the Yerushalmi. says there is no obligation of against the words of the Torah he is not criminally liable. If he says that have five sections, to add to the words of the Sages, he is guilty.” Rebbi Ḥananiah, the son of Rebbi Ada, in the name of Rebbi Tanḥum the son of Rebbi Ḥiyya: The words of the Sages carry more weight than those of the prophets, since it is written ( 2:6): “Do not preach, they preach; Do not preach to those, that shame does not reach you.” And it is written ( 2:11) “I shall preach to you for wine and liquor.” The relation of prophet and scholar can be compared to the case of a king who sent two of his notes the word but gives no explanation. Mussaphia, in his Notes to , proposes the impossible Greco-Latin hybrid πόλεμο-- , “secretary of war.” The best explanation seems to be that of A. Kohut, ; the first syllable was interpreted as Aramaic relative pronoun (Hebrew שֶׁ) and, therefore, dropped. is a late (Byzantine) form of , the holder of an imperial , a “doubly folded” imperial order or privilege which gave its holder the right to use the imperial mails for transportation. The two arrive in the province by imperial mail but this does not imply that they are plenipotentiaries (since, sometimes, the privilege of using the mails was given to private citizens.) to a province. About one of them he wrote, if he does not show you my seal and σημαντήθιον, do not believe him. About the other one he wrote, even if he does not show you my seal, believe him without seal and σημαντήθιον. So about a prophet is written ( 13:2) “He gives you a sign or miracle.” But here it is written ( 17:11): “According to the teachings that they will teach you” 25b, 153).. That means after the divine voice was heard. But before the divine voice was heard, 2:3 (in a different version 2:3). The main discussion in the Babli is 6b. The 24 instances of restrictions of the school of Hillel where the school of Shammai is more lenient are enumerated in Tosephta 2. It is reported there that the most conscientious one of the followers of Shammai in the years before the destruction of the Temple, R. Yoḥanan ben Haḥoranit, followed the rulings of the school of Hillel in practice. The man who rebuilt Jewish learning after the destruction of the Temple, R. Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, was a student of Hillel. it was said of anyone who wanted to restrict himself and follow the restrictions both of the school of Shammai and that of Hillel: ( 2:14) “the fool walks in darkness;” anyone who followed the leniencies of both of them was called an evildoer. But one had to follow either the leniencies and restrictions of one school or the leniencies and restrictions of the other. That was before the divine voice was heard. But after the divine voice was heard, practice always follows the school of Hillel and everyone who transgresses the rulings of the school of Hillel merits death. We have stated: “A divine voice came and said: Both of them are the words of the Living God but practice follows the school of Hillel”. 6b. The language is tannaïtic, but the origin of the phrase is unknown. Where was the divine voice heard? Rebbi Bibi in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: The divine voice came in Jabneh for the adoption of the rules of the school of Hillel by all of Judaism. It seems that the exact point in time was the reconstitution of the Synhedrion after the war of Bar Kokhba. While Talmudic literature is full of disagreements on practical points of Jewish practice, there is unanimity that the principles underlying all discussions are those fixed by the school of Hillel in Rabbinic (Pharisaic) Judaism. After the war of Bar Kokhba, we do not hear of any followers of the school of Shammai in practice, nor of Jews that are Sadducees in practice. In the Talmud (Babli 33b), R. Yose (ben Ḥalaphta) states that the Sadducees in his time follow Rabbinic practice. We know that the sect at Qumran were Sadducees and their follow Sadducee rules; characteristically, they have many more Biblical quotes in addition to the required verses (cf. Y. Yadin, , Jerusalem, 1978). The found with the Bar Kokhba letters in the caves of the Judean desert are of the same type. Hence, Sadducee practice did not completely stop until the war of Bar Kokhba. As far as Sadduceeism goes, its disappearance in practice can be dated to the aftermath of the war of Bar Kokhba. It is not believable that a man of the stature of Rebbi Tarphon would transgress a generally accepted practice supported by a divine pronouncement and by popular consent. Hence, the episode of Rebbi Tarphon must be dated in time before the . It is generally accepted that Rebbi Tarphon did not live to see the war of Bar Kokhba. This narrows the time of the to close to that war..",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: In the morning he offers two blessings before [the ] and one after. In the evening he offers two blessings before and two after, one long and one short. At a place where they said to make it long he is not allowed to make it short, short he is not allowed to make it long. To seal he is not allowed not to seal, not to seal he is not allowed to seal. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman: Because of. The first opinion, ascribed to an early Amora, gives the reason why the two recitations should be parallel and why each one has to include a benediction of thanks for the Torah, since the recitation of the also helps to fulfill the obligation of Torah-study in a minimal way. The second opinion, by a late Amora in the name of one of the first ones, explains the asymmetry in the numbers since they must add up to the odd number of 7. Since in Halakhah 9 (and in the Babli, 14b) it is reported that in Israel one did not recite the entire last section of in the evening, Rebbi Simon also gives a reason for the asymmetry: In the evening one recites 4 benedictions and 2 sections, in the morning 3 benedictions and 3 sections, for a total of 6 morning and evening. In the next section it is clear that Rebbi Simon makes a distinction between the first two and the third sections of , a distinction rejected by Rebbi Levi from the circle of Rebbi Yoḥanan. ( 1:8): “You should think about it day and night”, that the thinking of day and night should be equal. Rebbi Yose bar Rebbi Abin in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Because of ( 119:164): “Seven times a day I praise You for Your just laws.” Rebbi Nachman in the name of Rebbi Mani with its benedictions regularly, every evening and every morning, cannot be considered transgressing the obligation of Torah study even if he does not study otherwise. In contrast to the first two statements, this one has practical consequences.: Everybody who keeps “seven times a day I praise you” is as if he kept also “you should think about it day and night” 99b, Rebbi Yoḥanan reports in the name of R. Simeon bar Yoḥai that reading the alone is enough; no mention of the necessary benedictions.. Why does one read these two sections every day? Rebbi Simon says because they mention lying down and getting up. Rebbi Levi said, because the Ten Commandments are contained in them, he cannot agree that in the evening one should recite only two sections. In the Babli ( 12b), the third section of is singled out for its importance because five of the Ten Commandments are alluded to in it.. “I am the Eternal, your God.” - “Hear, o Israel, The Eternal, our God.” “You should not have any other gods before me.” - “The Eternal is One.” “Do not take the name of the Eternal, your God, in vain.” - “You must love the Eternal, your God.” He who loves the king will not swear in his name and lie. “Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it.” - “So that you shall remember;” Rebbi said: that is the commandment of Sabbath which is as important as all other commandments of the Torah together, as it is written ( 9:14): “You informed them about Your Sabbath, commandments, laws, and Torah you commanded them, …” to show that it is as important as the other commandments of the Torah. “Honor your father and mother” - “So that your days and the days of your children should increase.” “Do not murder” - “You will soon be lost.” He who kills will be killed. “Do not commit adultery” - “Do not stray after your hearts and after your eyes.” Rebbi Levi said: heart and eye are the two agents of sin. It is written ( 23:26) “My son, give Me your heart; your eyes should watch My ways.” The Holy One, Praise to Him, says: If you give me your heart and eyes I know that you are mine. “Do not steal” - “You shall harvest your grain,” not your neighbor’s grain 86a, that the Ten commandments forbid kidknapping, a capital crime like murder and adultery. The Babli’s opinion is found also in (Jithro 5), which possibly was edited in the Academy of Rav in Babylonia. The same attitude as here, that all stealing is prohibited, is found in , p. 153.” “Do not testify against your neighbor as a false witness,” - “I am the Lord, your God.” And it is written ( 10:10) “But the Lord is the God of truth.” What is truth? Rebbi Abun said: that ( 10:10) “He is God of life and king of the world.” Rebbi Levi said: The Holy One, praise to Him, said, if you gave false testimony against your neighbor, I count that against you as if you gave testimony against Me that I did not create heaven and earth 14b, on the statement that one is required to end the recitation of with “the Eternal is the God of truth.” Rabbi Abun (Rabin) was a younger contemporary of R. Levi.. “Do not covet your neighbor’s house” - “You shall write them on the doorposts of your house,” your house and not your neighbor’s house. There it was stated ( Mishnah 5:1): “The official in charge told them for the Ninth of Av.: recite one benediction! and they recited one benediction.” What benediction did they recite? Rav Mattanah in the name of Samuel: that is the benediction for the Torah. “Then they recited the Ten Commandments and the three sections of .” Rebbi Ammi in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: that means that the benedictions are no obstacle, it follows that the non-recitation of the benedictions preceding and following the does not invalidate the recitation of itself. The Babli (11b) has a totally different approach. First, they note that Rav Mattanah did not know what benediction was recited in the Temple and then they report that Rav Yehudah said in the name of Samuel that the second of the daily benedictions preceding the was recited. Rebbi Ammi in the name of R. Simeon ben Laqish is quoted that “benedictions do not invalidate one another”, i. e., the recitation of the second before the first is not an obstacle. The essential difference is that for the Babli, the last benediction before ‘, which is praise for the Torah and its study, may take the place of the explicit benediction for the Torah (e. g., for somebody who came late to the Synagogue and is reciting that benediction before he had a chance to recite the benediction for the Torah), whereas the Yerushalmi requires two benedictions unless one starts studying after the recitation of the without interruption; see below and 11b, שכבר.. Rebbi Abba said: From here you cannot draw any inference because the Ten Commandments contain the essence of were instituted for only, they are not applicable to the Ten Commandments; hence, the Ten Commandments, if recited at the start of the service, require the benediction for the Torah. On the other hand, in the preceding section is was shown that contains allusions to all of the Ten Commandments. Hence, is in a sense a duplication of the Ten Commandments and a separate benediction would be out of place.. Rav Mattanah and Rebbi Samuel ben Naḥman both say that it would have been logical to require that the Ten Commandments should be recited every day. Why does one not recite them? Because of the arguments of the Christians, that they should not say that only these were given to Moses at Sinai. Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Yehudah bar Zebida: It would have been logical that one also would have to recite the chapter of Balaq and Balaam every day 23:7–24:25.. Why does one not recite it? Not to incommodate the public too much. Rebbi Ḥuna said, because it mentions lying down and standing up 23:24, 24:9.. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said, because it contains the Exodus and God’s kingdom 24:8, 23:21.. Rebbi Eleazar said, because it is written in the Torah, in the Prophets, and in the Hagiographs. 6:5, in the Hagiographs 13:2 .“The official in charge told them: recite one benediction! and they recited one benediction.” What benediction did they recite? Rav Mattanah in the name of Samuel: that is the benediction for the Torah. But they did not yet recite “Creator of the Lights!, a celebration of God’s creation of the sun. The corresponding benediction in the evening is a celebration of God’s making the world revolve alternatingly into darkness and light.” Rebbi Samuel, brother of Rebbi Berekhiah, said: there is no light yet and you want to recite “Creator of the Lights”? ( Mishnah 5:1) On the Sabbath they add one benediction for the departing watch. What kind of benediction? Rebbi Ḥelbo said, that is it: May He Who resides in the Temple plant among you brotherliness and love, peace and neighborliness. Samuel said: If one got up early to study before he recited the he has to recite the benediction. After the recitation of he does not have to recite the benediction. Rebbi Abba is no substitute for the benediction on the Torah. The statement of Rebbi Abba, Babylonian immigrant to Israel, former student of Rav Yehudah, the student of Samuel, harmonizes Babylonian practice, expressed by Samuel, with Israeli theory by accepting the Babylonian practice but making it impracticable. על אתר is the same as Babylonian לאלתר “on the spot, immediately.” said, that is only if he studied immediately. Rebbi Ḥuna said: It is reasonable to say that for exegesis one has to recite the benediction, for practical rules one does not have to recite the benediction. Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Both for exegesis and for practical rules one has to recite the benediction. Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said: When we were sitting before Rav, he always required us to recite the benediction both for exegesis and for practical rules on the Torah, thus combining all aspects of Torah study. In the version of the Babli, the statement of Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi is separate from the preceding discussion and seems to indicate that the different aspects of Torah study should not be separated, in contrast to the Yerushalmi version.. It was stated is in Babli 37b.: He who recites with the men of , were the representatives of the Jewish people at the daily sacrifices. Since these sacrifices started very early, the men of had to participate before they could hold their prayers. Therefore, they started their morning prayers only after the daily morning sacrifice was completed. By that time, it was later than three hours into daylight and anyone else would be too late in their recitation. has not done his duty since they were too late. Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rebbi Ammi: In the days of Rebbi Yoḥanan we went out for a fast-day and recited after three hours and he did not oppose us, was said. By the time that a great many people were assembled and the sermon was given, it was rather late, later than three variable hours (one quarter of the time between sunrise and sundown).. Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Aḥa went out for a fast-day. The public came and recited after three hours. Rebbi Aḥa wanted to oppose them. Rebbi Yose said to him: Did they not recite at its due time, now they only recite it in order to stand in prayer after words of the Torah. He answered back: It is because of the uneducated, who should not say that the recitation was in its correct time. These are the benedictions that one makes long 1:6. In Tosephta 1:7, the list of the short benedictions is repeated as that of benedictions which do not have a separate ending (where, however, Rebbi Yose Hagalili disagrees about the fourth benediction of Grace.) Towards the end of the here, Rebbi Yudan will explain that Tosephta 1:7 gives the definition of “short” in the Mishnah and Tosephta 1:6; hence, it follows that “long” is identical with “having a separate ending: Praise to You, o Eternal, …” That identification has been accepted by most Medieval authorities. However, originally the definition seems to have been the one given here and in Tosephta 1:6, , that there exist benedictions, those of of , all prayers of with the Confessions, and the additional benedictions in the prayer of a public fast for rain (a lengthened Seventh benediction followed by six additional ones, detailed in Mishnah 2:4) which were not those of the congregation, but of the cantor who in Israel at that time was supposed to present his own compositions, and those of the list had to be long. Then there exists a short list of short benedictions that may not be lengthened by poetic insertion. And finally, there exist the benedictions not mentioned here at all, like the benedictions before and after the recitation of , where it seems the cantor may produce poetic insertions without being characterized either as scholar or as uneducated.: the benedictions for and , and the benedictions for a public fast day. From his benedictions one can tell whether someone is a scholar or is uneducated. These are the benedictions that one makes short: He who makes a benediction over a commandment and on fruits, the introductory paragraph of Grace, , #16) read “the benediction over food (מזון)” instead of (זימון), the introductory paragraph. This reading would explain the seemingly redundant “Grace after a meal” but is it not supported by any manuscript either of the Yerushalmi or the Tosephta. explains this “benediction over food (מזון)” as the benediction the meal., and the last benediction in Grace after the meal, 36a). The extensions that today make the benediction short in form but long in text are mainly of Babylonian origin; cf. the discussion in the author’s , pp. 358–359.. Hence, all other benedictions one should make long. Ḥizqiah said: From what we have stated: He who makes it long is despicable, he who makes is short is praiseworthy, which means that this is not a principle. We have stated: One has to make long the benediction “Who saves Israel” on a fast day. Hence., the six additional benedictions he should not make long. Rebbi Yose said: You should not say: because this is part of one should not make it long, therefore it is necessary to say: One has to make long the benediction “Who saves Israel” on a fast day. These are the benedictions for which one bows down and its benedictions at all but about the eighteen benedictions of the , the subject of Chapters 3 and 4. In the Babli, the place of this discussion is in Chap. 4, p. 34a. The reason that the subject is taken up in this context in the Yerushalmi is that in the Tosephta ( 1:8) it is dealt with immediately after the discussion of short and long benedictions. (In Tosephta and Babli, the verb “to bow down” is שחה, not שחח as in the Yerushalmi. This is another indication that the Tosephta in our hands today is a Babylonian edition of an originally Israeli text.): The first and before the benediction “Shield of Abraham.”, beginning and end; “thanks”, beginning and end. One who bows down for every benediction is taught that he should not bow down. Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: The High Priest bows down at the end of every benediction; the king at the start and the end of every benediction. Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Once the king bows down deeply he does not get up until he finishes his entire prayer 5:4 where it is reported that Rabban Gamliel, on occasion of the joyous dance for the drawing of water on Sukkot not only had a fire dance with eight different torches swirling in the air but also showed “bowing down to one’s knees” as making a push-up by supporting oneself not on two hands but only on two fingers. This introduction has fallen out here and the two termsכריצה, בריכה have been switched. What the Yerushalmi calls בריכה, the parallel in the Babli ( 22b, also 34b) calls קידה, “falling on one’s face”.. What is the reason? ( 8:54) “It was when Solomon finished all this prayer and supplication to the Eternal, he got up before the Eternal’s altar and did no longer bow down on his knees.” 5:4 where it is reported that Rabban Gamliel, on occasion of the joyous dance for the drawing of water on Sukkot not only had a fire dance with eight different torches swirling in the air but also showed “bowing down to one’s knees” as making a push-up by supporting oneself not on two hands but only on two fingers. This introduction has fallen out here and the two termsכריצה, בריכה have been switched. What the Yerushalmi calls בריכה, the parallel in the Babli ( 22b, also 34b) calls קידה, “falling on one’s face”. What is bowing down to one’s knees and what is kneeling? The great Rebbi Ḥiyya demonstrated kneeling before Rebbi, he got up lame and was healed. Rebbi Levi ben Sisi demonstrated bowing down to his knees before Rebbi, he got up lame and was not healed. ( 8:54) “His hands raised to Heaven.” Rebbi Ayvu said: He was standing as if inanimate. Rebbi Eleazar bar Avina said: He made clear that these palms did not get at all dirty during the building of the Temple 29:1–9) not a penny was sticking to his own palms.. Rebbi Ḥalaphta ben Shaül. The Babli ( 34b) quotes that Rava, Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet actually fell down on their knees for ; the Talmud quotes a which explicitly forbids falling down on one’s knees. Louis Ginzberg assumes that in Israel, falling on one’s knees was always strictly forbidden since their synagogues were built of stone with stone floors and falling on one’s knees on a stone floor outside the Temple is forbidden. In Babylonia, where synagogues were brick with hardened dirt floors, falling on one’s knees was permitted. stated: Everybody bows down with the cantor for the benediction of thanksgiving. Rebbi Zeïra said: But only for the word . Rebbi Zeïra was attentive to the Qeroba is the cantor, the שליח ציבור, who presents his own poetic of the prayer, the , קרובות or קרובץ, to the congregation for the repetition of the , as noted by L. Ginzberg. סבר here seems to mean “to be attentive”, as in the exclamation before the סברי “please pay attention”. It seems that Rebbi Zeïra timed his thanksgiving, one of the longer texts given here, so he could end his benediction in unison with the cantor. to bow his head at the beginning and at the end. Rebbi Yose when he came up here from Babylonia to Israel. The Babli ( 40a) also reports very short texts by Rav, Samuel, Rebbi Simai (also of the generation between Tannaïm and Amoraïm) and a slightly longer one by Rav Aḥa bar Jacob (a student of Rav Huna, the student of Rav). Most of these texts are so short that they do not lead to the congregation whispering for any length of time. saw them bowing down and whispering. He said to them: What is this whispering? He had not heard what Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rebbi Simeon said in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan, in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah, Rebbi Ḥanina in the name of Rebbi Miasha, Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Simai, and some say, the colleagues in the name of Rebbi Simai: We thank You, Master of all creatures, God of praises, eternal Rock, Life of the Universe, Creator, Who resurrects the dead, that You have made us alive, kept us, gave us merit, supported us, and brought us near to give thanks to Your name; praised be You, o Eternal, God of thanksgiving. Rebbi Abba bar Zavda in the name of Rav: We thank You since we are obliged to give thanks; may my lips sing, for I shall sing to You with my soul that You have redeemed; praised are You, o Eternal, God of thanksgiving. Rebbi Samuel bar Inia in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: Thanksgiving and praise to Your name, Yours is greatness, Yours is strength, Yours is glory! May it please You, o Eternal, our God and God of our fathers, that You may support us in our fall, straighten us up from our bent state, because You support the falling and straighten up the bent ones, You are full of mercy and nothing exists except You; praised are You, o Eternal, God of thanksgiving. Bar Qappara, Ktav 1992, München 1996, both p. xviii. While the previous texts were quoted in historical order, the text of Bar Qappara should have been the first. The reason may be his extensive use of Biblical verses that were a matter of controversy, see below (and in all Yerushalmi versions this is a formal benediction.) said: For You we fall down, for You we bend down, for You we prostrate ourselves, for You we kneel, to You every knee should fall down and every tongue swears. ( 29:11–13): Yours, o Eternal, is greatness, strength, glory, victory, and majesty, truly all that is in heaven and on earth; Yours, o Eternal, is the kingdom, and You lift Yourself over all as head. Riches and honor are before You, You rule over all; in Your hand is power and strength, it is in Your hand to make great and strengthen everything. And now, our God, we thank You and praise Your glorious name; with all our heart and soul we prostrate ourselves before You. ( 35:10) My entire self shall say: O Eternal, who is like You, Who saves the destitute from one who is stronger than he is, the destitute and poor from the one who robs him. Praised are You, o Eternal, God of thanksgiving. Rebbi Yudan said: the rabbis used to say all of these 40a. It appears from here that Rav Papa (fifth generation in Babylonia) had good precedent for his ruling from Rebbi Yudan (fourth generation in Israel). The method of Rebbi Yudan/Rav Papa is more adequate to a collection of short statements as given in the Babli than to the very long pieces quoted here in the Yerushalmi.. But some say, either one or the other. We have stated: Only that one should not bow down too much, the discussion now returns to the statement that one has to bow twice at the beginning and the end of the .. Rebbi Jeremiah said: On condition that one should not behave like that large lizard 12b in the Venice print quote this Yerushalmi as הירוגא and declares it to be the Yerushalmi translation of צָב ( 11:29). In the Wilna Talmud Babli, the word was changed to הרדונא following our text. In the (-), the translation of צב is חַדְרוֹנָא. It seems that the takes Hebrew צב as parallel to Arabic צַ֗בּ “lizard” (of all sizes), not as “turtle” as in late Biblical and modern Hebrew. Rebbi Jeremiah means that, while one should not bow down too much, on the other hand one should not behave like a lizard which keeps its body quiet and moves only the head when it is catching flies. He requires that one should bow down enough so that all bones of one’s spine are moved in God’s praise., but ( 35:10) “All my bones should say, o Eternal, who is like You?” The word of Ḥanan bar Abba and remain bowed to the end of their private supplication, even though he formulates his statement in terms of the first benediction of which starts and ends with “Praised are You, ”, but his statement is applicable to all other situations, that one never should be bowed when mentioning the Name. disagrees since Ḥanan bar Abba said to the colleagues: I shall tell you one of the good things that I saw Rav do and, when I told it before Samuel, he got up and kissed me on my mouth. At “praised are You”, he bows down. When he comes to mention , he straightens up. Samuel said: I shall give the reason ( 35:10): “The Eternal straightens the bent ones.” Rebbi Ammi said: It is not reasonable, but ( 2:5): “Before My Name he is low.” Rebbi Abun said: If it were written “at My Name he is low” then you would be right, but it is written “before My Name he is low”, before he mentions he is low. Rebbi Samuel bar Nathan 9:4, see on that text). It is difficult to decide the opinion of the Yerushalmi about whether in practice one removes or simply scolds such a cantor since Rebbi Ammi is in general the higher authority but Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba is quoted in the last, preferred, position. in the name of Rebbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: It happened that one bowed down too much and Rebbi removed him. Rebbi Ammi said, Rebbi Yoḥanan did remove. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, he did not remove but scold. These are the benedictions one begins with “Praised”. All benedictions one begins with “Praised”, but a benediction following another one, e. g., the recitation of and , one does not begin with “Praised”. 46a) it reads: All benedictions one begins with “Praised” except for benedictions over fruits, obligations, benedictions following another one and the last benediction of the recitation of . In the Tosephta ( 1:9) it reads: All benedictions one begins with “Praised” except for benedictions following another one and the last benediction of the recitation of . The versions of the Tosephta and the Babli are essentially identical, except that the Babli for completeness includes the short benedictions of one sentence for the execution of a and for eating food, whose form otherwise is taken for granted. The main difference between the Babli/Tosephta and the Yerushalmi is that the last benediction for the , the one recited after , is considered by the Yerushalmi to be the continuation of the second benediction before but for the Babli it needs special mention. The consequence is that for the Yerushalmi all prayer benedictions separated by Scriptural readings from a preceding benediction are considered consecutive (the benedictions after the morning Psalms and ) whereas for the Babli each one needs special treatment. The first objection to the rule given in the next paragraph is therefore impossible for the Babli. Rebbi Jeremiah objected: But there is “redemption” in the night: “Praised are You, o Eternal, our God, King of the Universe, Who has redeemed us and has redeemed our forefathers from Egypt and let us attain this night to eat and bitter herbs. May it please You, o Eternal, our God and God of our fathers, to let us attain in peace more festive seasons and holidays, when we shall rejoice in the rebuilding of Your city and enjoy Your service. There we shall eat from the family offerings and the sacrifice whose blood shall reach the wall of Your altar for goodwill. Then we shall thank You with a new song for our redemption and the liberation of our persons. Praise be to You, o Eternal, Who did save Israel.” This benediction follows the recitation of the first two Psalms of . It is clear from here, and from the parallel in the last Chapter of Yerushalmi that in Israel in Talmudic times one preceded the recitation of by a benediction (the details are discussed in the author’s , pp. 317–318). Hence, by the principle of the Yerushalmi, this benediction should not start with “Praised”.. There is a difference since Rebbi Yoḥanan said 9:1, fol. 37c. In Galilee there existed congregations which were illiterate except for the cantor, where no one could recite the or the entire at home. For these people it was instituted that should be recited in the synagogue after evening prayers (with its benedictions before and after); then the people could go home and just recite the benediction for redemption, drink four cups and go to bed. The text there seems to imply that the required recital of the Exodus likewise was read to them in the synagogue. The generally accepted implication of this and the following arguments is that any benediction which under some circumstances could be recited by itself has the status of a benediction that is not following another one ( on Babli 36a).: If he heard in the synagogue he has fulfilled his obligation. Rebbi Eleazar, the son of Rebbi Yose, objected before Rebbi Yose, but there is its ending. and refers simply to the concluding statement “Praise be to You, o Eternal, Who did save Israel.” Since this follows the entire text, it certainly is a benediction following another one, so why does it repeat “Praise be to You, o Eternal”? He said to him: there are two, one for the future and one for the past. 117b notes that the benediction for redemption after and in the is גאל ישׂראל but that in the prayer is גואל ישׂראל. The same formulation, גאל ישׂראל, is found in the Mishnah and is followed by the texts with the exception of the Yemenite ones. The unvocalized text of Mishnah and Talmud is read גָּאַל יִשְׂרָאֵל in the past tense. Then Rebbi Yose’s statement makes sense. Since the text concentrates on the future after a perfunctory mention of the past, the conclusion by a benediction for the past is a change of theme and, therefore, the concluding phrase has to be considered a separate benediction. [Rebbi Yose belongs to those authorities who require that the topic of the final benediction should be repeated before the final sentence. His opinion is superseded here by that of Rebbi Mana later in the discussion but is taken up again by Rebbi Aḥa.] The very conservative Yemenite tradition, strictly based on the Babli, cannot be expected to disregard a prescription of that Talmud. Hence, it is possible that Rava did read גָּאֵל יִשְׂרָאֵל, a form of the present [cf. S. Morag, בנין פָּאֵל וּבנין נִתְפָּאֵל, (1957), 349–356 and the material quoted in the author’s , p. 322.] The Yerushalmi here shows that the Israeli reading was גָּאַל יִשְׂרָאֵל. Hence, identical (consonantal) wording in Babli and Yerushalmi does not necessarily imply same text and same meaning. Since Italian and Northern European Jewry obtained their prayer texts from Israel, probably in the Mishnaic period, it is the rule that their prayer texts follow Yerushalmi sources. They objected: There is . benediction at the end of the Sabbath is preceded by benedictions over wine, spices, and light. These are all short sentences and it is universally agreed that they should start with “praise”. The only problem is the benediction itself, which follows the other ones. The answer is that the benedictions over spices and fire are recited in order only for convenience, not out of necessity, and that Rebbi did recite them separately. Hence, is a potentially freestanding benediction, but it follows always the benediction for wine. The objection based on this is not raised, but it will be raised for and the answer given there also applies here. It is explained in Babli 54a that Rebbi was collecting the other benedictions on the cup for his family, not for himself. There is a difference since Rebbi Abba bar Zavda said that Rebbi was dispersing them and collecting them on the cup. The great Rebbi Ḥiyya was collecting them. They objected: There is . There is a difference, because if there were two sitting together and eating they would not say . There is “He Who feeds all”. The lack of an answer here is provisional; the final answer of the Amoraïm of the last Galilean generation covers all these cases.; that is difficult. There is “He Who is good and does good”. There is a difference since Rav Ḥuna said: When permission was received to bury the slain of Bethar, “He Who is good and does good” was fixed, “He Who is good” because they did not rot, “He Who does good” because permission was received to bury them. There is during a meal does not require the benediction over wine even though there is an interruption in the meal since one is forbidden to eat and drink after sundown Friday night before making . The Babli does not take up this question, hence practice follows this Yerushalmi, 271, Sec. 4. The starts with “praised” and its final sentence again starts with “praised.”. There is a difference since if one was sitting and drinking when it still was day and the holy day came upon him, he does not say “Creator of the fruit of the vine.” But there is its final sentence? Rebbi Mana said, the type of benedictions is like that. Rebbi Yudan said: A short form starts with “Praised” and does not end with “Praised”, a long form starts with “Praised” and ends with “Praised”. All benedictions after their seals; one does not say a verse as benediction. Rebbi Isaac ben Rebbi Eleazar objected before Rebbi Yose: Because you say after their seals, one does not say a verse as benediction, there should be a logical connection between them but there seems to be none.? They said, that young man is intelligent because he thinks! What is the meaning of “after their seals”? It is that when he was standing in the morning prayer and forgot and mentioned the text of evening prayers but he caught himself and finished with the text of morning prayers, then he did his duty does not deal with it; its correct interpretation is by Rebbi Aḥa. About the rule itself, there is disagreement between the Yerushalmi and the parallel Babli, 12a, where it is stated: “If in the morning one started with ‘Creator of light’ and ended with ‘Making evenings dark’, he did not do his duty. If in the evening he starts with ‘He Who makes evenings dark’ and ends with ‘Creator of light’, he did not do his duty. But if he started with ‘Creator of light’ and ended with ‘Making evenings dark’, he did his duty. The principle is: Everything is determined by the seal.” The Babli asserts that if in evening prayers one started out wrongly with the text appropriate for morning prayers then everything is O.K. if only the final doxology is correct. But the Yerushalmi speaks of one “who is standing in morning prayers and forgot”, i. e., that he started out correctly, forgot himself in the middle, and remembered in time to close with the correct text. The principles of prayer texts were instituted by the Men of the Great Assembly. They determined the contents of the prayers but not, in general, their texts. (For the , the Mishnah even reports that Rebbi Eliezer says that one who repeats the same text for more than 30 days cannot really be an honest supplicant). The question is whether, in addition to the contents, the Men of the Great Assembly only determined the “seals” (following the Babli) or also the introductory sentences (following the Yerushalmi).. Rebbi Aḥa said, all benedictions in the kind of their seals. 104a) this principle is spelled out only for [and in the Yerushalmi the treatment given for , ( 5:2, fol. 9b) supports R. Eleazar Askari.] Most Medieval authorities extend the principle of the Babli to all longer benedictions. But those who say ( 12:6): “Jubilate and sing, inhabitant of Zion …” do not violate the rule that no benediction is a verse 41, p. 450) has published a Yerushalmi prayer text from the Cairo Genizah which uses this verse in the third benediction of the ‘, קדושת השם. From what is left of the original Galilean it seems clear that the standard text of longer benedictions always ended with a Biblical verse just preceding the “seal”. For example, in Grace, the verses were 145:16, , Ps. 147:2. In the morning prayers, the verses have survived in the first benediction for in all and for the benediction after in most of them. The text states that the only acceptable place for a Biblical verse is the “seal”. Even the Mishnah prescribes benedictions whose text is a Biblical verse ( 2:2); what is prohibited here is using a verse in the final doxology..",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: One must mention the Exodus in the night. Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah said to them the Yerushalmi text is preserved only in the text of Maimonides and the Yemenite . Nevertheless, the phrase cannot refer to the discussion at Bne Beraq reported in the . As R. Saul Lieberman points out, the Yerushalmi takes R. Eleazar ben Azariah at his word that he made his statement when he was close to 70 years old and it is quite impossible that R. Eliezer should still have been alive at least 50 years after the deposition of Rabban Gamliel and the elevation of Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah. The most likely interpretation is that the Israeli , but not the Mishnah, read “to them” and that the copyist of the Yerushalmi followed his memory from the instead of the text before him. For a similar occurrence in the Septuagint, see , p. 257–258.: Here I am about 70 years old and I could not succed in proving that the Exodus must be mentioned every night and the mention of the Exodus are obligatory as an institution of the Men of the Great Assembly. The only question is whether the benediction was instituted as a Rabbinic ordinance or was formulated in fulfillment of a Biblical commandment. until Ben Zoma derived it from the verse ( 16:3): “… that you should remember the day of your leaving Egypt the entire days of your life.” The days of your life - the days. The entire days of your life - the nights. But the Sages say, the days of your life - this world; The entire days of your life - this includes the times of the Messiah. HALAKHAH: Even though he entered high office he lived long. This means that high office shortens one’s life. There they say one should not start 15:37–41. This is the only part of that mentions the Exodus. The statement of “there” is reported in the Babli by Rav Cahana in the name of Rav ( 14b). but if one did start he has to finish. The rabbis here say one starts but does not finish. The Mishnah disagrees with the rabbis here in the next section seems to imply that one does not mention the third section at all, against Israeli practice.: “One must mention the Exodus in the night.” Rebbi Abba, Rav Yehudah in the name of Rav: We thank You that You took us out of Egypt and redeemed us from the house of slavery to give thanks to Your Name.. It is the answer to the objection raised in the first sentence. The obligation of mentioning the Exodus does not refer to the recitation of the third section of but to the benediction after the and, therefore, would be fulfilled even if the third section were to be omitted completely. The text in the Babli is longer. A disagrees with the rabbis there: is used only during daytime. The entire section of is used only during daytime. Rebbi Abba bar Aḥa descended there and saw them start and finish; he had not heard that there they say one does not have to start but if he started he has to finish. The rabbis here say one starts and does not finish. They asked before Rebbi Aḥiyya ben Rebbi Zeïra: How did your father do in practice, like the teachers here or the teachers there. Rebbi Ḥizqiah said, like the teachers here. Rebbi Yose said, like the teachers there. Rebbi Ḥanina said, it is reasonable like R. Yose, since R. Zeïra always chose the harder way8:7, fol. 12c. and they chose the harder way, so he did what he was used to, like them. We have stated 2:1) containing the statements of the anonymous first Tanna, Rebbi, and “Others” (usually: Rebbi Meïr), and then the comment by the Amora R. Joshua ben Levi. In practice, the ruling of R. Joshua ben Levi applies to both morning and evening prayers.: “He who recites in the morning must mention the Exodus in . Rebbi says, he must mention [God’s] kingdom. Others say, he has to mention the splitting of the Reed Sea and the slaying of the firstborn.” Rebbi Joshua ben Levi says, he has to mention all these and has to say “Rock of Israel and its Redeemer”. 117b). This formula has survived in the poetic forms of Ashkenazic evening prayers for the holidays, while in ordinary prayers the form prescribed by the authoritative Babylonian Talmud has prevailed. Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi says: If someone did not mention Torah in the benediction on the Land 48b) is a Tannaïtic text in different order. The Amoraïc text of the Yerushalmi is in strict chronological order: R. Joshua ben Levi of the very early second generation, R. Abba bar Aḥa of the second, and Rebbi Ilaï of the third generations. The second statement of R. Abba bar Aḥa is attributed by the printed editions and most Medieval authors of the Babli to Rebbi Eliezer but in the Munich ms. to Rebbi, as in the Yerushalmi. The first statement is attributed to an otherwise unknown Tanna Naḥum the elder. The statement of R. Joshua ben Levi is attributed to Rebbi Yose (ben Ḥalaphta) but without the verse that gives the reason. The Yerushalmi gives a statement of Amoraïm, not to claim that the required topics were introduced by Amoraïm (that is quite obvious from the mention of Rebbi), but in order to point out the Scriptural basis and to fix the exact place where Torah has to be mentioned in Grace. one tells him to repeat. What is the reason? ( 105:44) “He gave them the lands of peoples”; why? “That they should keep His decrees and preserve His teachings.” Rebbi Abba ben Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi: If one did not mention the covenant in the benediction on the Land or the kingdom of David’s dynasty in “Builder of Jerusalem”, cf. , p. 357–358., one tells him to repeat. Rebbi Ilaï said: if he said “He Who consoles Jerusalem”, he did his duty. Bar Qappara and Grace); now we turn to required language in general speech. In the Babli, the parallel (13a) appears also at the end of the first Chapter, somewhat disconnected. One may assume that it is mentioned in parallel to the Yerushalmi. In the printed editions of the Babli, the text is: “Bar Qappara stated”, a Tannaïtic statement. However, in the Munich ms. and the the text reads דרש בר קפרא “Bar Qappara preached”, an Amoraïc statement. (It also seems that Rebbi Eliezer, who completes the statement of Bar Qappara in the Babli in parallel to Rebbi Levi in the Yerushalmi, is “Rebbi Eleazar, the son of Bar Qappara’s sister”.) The people who object are determined in the Babli to be Rebbi Yose bar Abin or Rebbi Yose bar Zabida, of the later generation of Galilean Amoraïm. The statements of Bar Qappara and Rebbi Levi/Rebbi Eleazar are not mentioned in any of the Medieval codes, ; their authors took also the text in the Babli as Amoraïc sermon. said: He who calls Abraham Abram transgresses a positive commandment. Rebbi Levi said, a positive and a negative commandment. ( 17:4) “Your name shall not in the future be called Abram”, that is the negative commandment, “But your name shall be Abraham”, that is the positive commandment. They objected: But the Men of the Great Assembly called him Abram, ( 9:7) “You are, o Eternal, the God Who selected Abram”. There is a difference, while he was still Abram You selected him. Similarly, does he who calls Sarah Sarai transgress a commandment? He 17:15): “God said to Abraham: Your wife Sarai, do not call her name Sarai but Sarah is her name.” The commandment to call Sarai Sarah was directed to Abraham alone. was commanded regarding her. Similarly, does he who calls Israel Jacob transgress a commandment? The second name was given him in addition, the first was not taken away from him. Why were the names of Abraham and Jacob changed but Isaac’s name was not changed? The former were given their names by their fathers; but Isaac was called Isaac by the Holy One, Praise to His Name, as it is said ( 17:19) “You shall call his name Isaac”. Four were given names before they were born, and they are Isaac, Ismael, Josiah, and Solomon. Isaac, ( 17:19) “You shall call his name Isaac”. Ismael as it is written ( 16:11): “You shall call his name Ismael”. Josiah, ( 13:2): “Behold, a son will be born to the dynasty of David; his name will be Josiah”. Solomon, ( 22:9) “Solomon will be his name” 12:24–25 it seems that David gave the name Solomon to his son and Nathan called him Yedidiah after his birth; it is clear from Chronicles that the name Solomon was not David’s invention but prophetically pre-ordained.. All this for the just. But the wicked ( 58:4) “The wicked are perverted from the womb.” Ben Zoma said: There will be a future time when Israel will no longer mention the Exodus. What is the reason? ( 23:7–8) “Therefore, days will come, says the Eternal, that one no longer will say, by the Eternal Who brought the Children of Israel up from Egypt, but rather, by the Eternal Who raised and brought the descendants of the House of Israel from the Northern land …” They said to him, not that the Exodus will be eliminated but the Exodus will be additional to the Kingdoms. The Kingdoms will be principal and the Exodus additional. And similarly it was said ( 35:10): :Your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name.” Not that the name Jacob will be taken away but Jacob will be additional to Israel. Israel will be principal and Jacob additional. And so it says ( 43:18–19): “Do not remember the first things”; this means the Egyptians, “And what was earlier do not dwell on”; this means the Kingdoms, “Behold, I create something new, now it will grow”; this refers to Gog. They gave a simile: to what can this be compared? To someone who encountered a wolf and was saved from it. He started telling about the wolf when he encountered a lion and was saved from it. He forget about the wolf and started telling about the lion.After that, he encountered a snake and was saved from it. He forgot about both of them and started telling about the snake. So it is with Israel, the last troubles make them forget the earlier ones.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If someone was reading in the Torah at the time of recital., if he read with intention. he fulfilled his duty, otherwise he did not fulfill his duty. Between the sections, one greets people out of respect and answers their greetings. In the middle of a section one may greet because of fear and answer, the words of Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Yehudah says: in the middle of a section one may greet out of fear and answer for respect, between sections one greets for respect and answers greetings from everybody. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Abba said: This means that benedictions do not prevent without requiring an interruption for recitations of the benedictions, it follows that benedictions are a separate obligation. In a number of prayer texts from the Genizah, the recitation of the has a separate benediction: “Praised be You, o Eternal, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us through His commandments and commanded us about the recitation of with a full heart to declare Him King over us, and willingly to declare His Unity.” While these texts are from a period about 500 years later than the text of the Yerushalmi, they show that recitation of was then still considered an obligation separate from the benedictions mentioned in the Mishnah. The latter benedictions could then be recited before the . See Ezra Fleischer,תפילה ומנהגי תפילה ,ארץ־ישראליים בתקופת הגניזה Jerusalem 1988. The paragraph has been explained as parallel to the Babli (11b–12a) by R. Solomon ben Adrat () in his responsa, vol. 1, no 319.. Rebbi Yose said: If you say that one needs to recite the benedictions; when he recited them he must focus his attention for the entire certainly one requires total attention during the recitation of . As seen at the end of this paragraph, this is not the rule.. They objected: Does he not interrupt and it does not appear in our statement? separately since they are written at different places in the Torah scroll. Since the Mishnah does not mention the necessary interruptions in the recital, it might be possible that the Mishnah contemplates interruptions for the recitation of the benedictions before and after ; hence, the inference of Rebbi Abba is not justified. So here also, even though it has not been stated he must recite the benedictions. That means, one must focus one’s attention for the entire . We may hear it from the following: Rebbi Aḥai, in the Yeshivah of Rebbi Ḥiyya. He belongs to the generation between Tannaïm and Amoraïm. His statement, 2:2 (Babli 13a), shows that Rebbi Yose’s argument is correct and that Rebbi Abba stated the practice correctly. (In the printed editions of the Babli, the name is Rebbi Aḥa, but in the Munich manuscript, and in all manuscripts of the Tosephta, the name is correctly Rebbi Aḥai. Rebbi Aḥa is an Amora of the fourth generation.) said in the name of Rebbi Yehudah: “He has fulfilled his obligation if he focussed his attention for the first paragraph, even though he did not focus his attention during recitation of the second paragraph”. What is the difference between the first and second paragraphs? Rebbi Ḥanina said: Everything mentioned in the first paragraph is mentioned in the second. In that case, should one have to recite only one of them? Rebbi Illa said: The first one is directed to the individual, the second one to the community; the first one concentrates on learning, the second one on doing. Bar Qappara said: One has to focus his attention only during the first three verses 6:4, must be recited with focussed attention. Another difference between the more demanding Yerushalmi and the Babli is that the Yerushalmi requires the rest of to be “repeated”, i.e., memorized, whereas in the Babli it has only to be read.. It was stated thus: ( 6:7) “You should repeat” until there is the obligation of focussed attention; from there starts the obligation of repetition. Rebbi Ḥunah, Rebbi Uri since he follows the ruling of Rebbi Aḥai in the name of Rebbi Yehudah that the entire first paragraph requires concentrated attention., Rav Joseph, Rav Yehudah in the name of Samuel: One has to accept the Kingdom of Heaven standing. Does this mean that one has to get up when one is sitting? No, if one is walking he has to stand still. It was stated: One has to prolong “is One”.. The composition here is difficult to understand since one starts with a tannaïtic statement (“It was stated”), continues with the opinion of an Amora (Rav Naḥman bar Jacob), and then returns to a Tanna (Symmachos, an outstanding student of Rebbi Meïr). The parallel Babli (13b) starts with the statement of Symmachos and then continues with the statement of Rav Naḥman bar Jacob which is quoted there in the name of Rav Aḥa bar Jacob. It is possible that “Aḥa”, a name without meaning, is simply a form of endearment of the formal name “Naḥman”, and that in the Babli it is necessary to use the form of endearment to distinguish this Amora from Rav Naḥman, quoted without his father’s name because of his exalted status, whose full name seems to have been Rav Naḥman bar Jacob. Rav Naḥman bar Jacob said: But only at the ., was pronounced like an Arabic ذ, or a voiced English , a sibilant sometimes close to ז. For example, the Aramaic די appears in the Elephantine papyri as זי. Hence, it really was possible to prolong the consonant since it was not a plosive sound as it is today. In the Babli (13b), Rav Ashi adds that one should not omit to pronounce the ח. This was because in Babylonia, as in Medieval Ashkenaz, a ח was pronounced like a stronger ה and therefore tended to be silent in the middle of a word, as ה is mostly silent in the middle of a word in modern Hebrew. (Even the masters of the Massorah tried to counteract this tendency, e. g. by punctuating יִֽהְיֶה, to make the heard when it should be silent by grammatical rules, so that the Torah reader should be forced to pronounce the ה, but obviously to no avail.) Symmachos bar Joseph said: Anyone who prolongs “is One” has his days and years prolonged in wellbeing. Rebbi Jeremiah was prolonging very much. Rebbi Zeïra said to him: So much is unnecessary, only so long that you should think of Him as King of Heaven and Earth and the four directions of the world. Rav asked Rebbi Ḥiyya: But I never see that Rebbi accepts upon himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven. He answered him: When you will see him cover his face with his hand, at that moment he accepts the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven. 13b. It seems that Rebbi started his Yeshivah classes early in the morning, before one could recite and continued until it was too late to recite as “acceptance of the yoke of heaven”, but only as “reading from the Torah.” He asked him back: Is it not necessary also to mention the Exodus? He answered him: It is impossible that he should not turn his words. Rebbi Tavyome asked Rebbi Ḥizkiah: Does this not mean that one has to focus attention only for the first verse? while covering his face with his hand during his morning classses, he could not have spent much time on it and, therefore, Rebbi does not accept the opinion of Bar Qappara that the first three verses have to be recited with focussed attention. He said to him: With that he might recite until “You shall repeat.” . The parallel in the Babli, 18b, quotes both Rebbi Muna and Rav, but from a discussion of the rules of blowing the , given below; they change the statement of Rav to “practice does not follow” and consider the statement here to be the opinion of Rebbi Yehudah only. Rebbi Muna said in the name of Rebbi Yehudah who said in the name of Rebbi Yose the Galilean: If one interrupted so that he would have been able to read all of it, he did not fulfill his duty. Rebbi Abba, Rav Jeremiah in the name of Rav: The practice follows Rebbi Muna who said in the name of Rebbi Yehudah who said in the name of Rebbi Yose the Galilean. Rebbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Jehozadak: The same rule 34b) quotes the same statement and declares that this is only the opinion of Rebbi Yoḥanan’s teacher but not his own, and, therefore, is not followed in practice, since arbitrary interruptions are allowed for blowing the . The Yerushalmi differs from the Babli in that the principle of time limitation of interruptions in recitals is accepted without reservation; the blowing of on Rosh Hashanah is not a recitation and, therefore, can follow different rules. applies to and the reading of the Esther scroll. Abba bar Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda sat together and said, the same rule applies to blowing the . They went up to Rav’s Yeshivah and heard Rav Ḥuna in the name of Rav: Even if one heard it in up to nine hours he fulfilled his obligation. Rebbi Zeiïa said: When I was there, this was a problem for me or not. This shows that Rav Ḥuna’s ruling was not widely accepted in Babylonia in his time.. When I came here, I heard Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Even if one heard it during an entire day, one has fulfilled one’s obligation18b, 34b).. But only if one heard it in the correct order. Rebbi Yose investigated: If one needed to hear the first simple tone and another one the final simple tone, one blow of the serves the requirements of both of them” but “to listen to the sound of the ”; hence, it is the personal obligation of each listener and does not depend on the intention of the blower.. Rebbi Abin bar Ḥiyya investigated: The recitation of with its benedictions, it (the recitation of ) without its benedictions, its benedictions without it with its benedictions, or without benedictions, and does the rule of interruptions apply at all to the benedictions? The question remains unanswered.? If he interrupted after a third, interrupted after a second third? Does one estimate by the reader’s speed or by the average speed of all men? Rebbi Mattaniah(2:2), the reading is: Rebbi Mattaniah said: Is it not reasonable that …, with a rhetorical negation [interpretation of Rashba (Rebbi Shelomo ben Adrat) in his commentary to the Mishnah in .] said, it seems reasonable by the reader’s. Rebbi Abbahu asked Rebbi Yoḥanan: Assuming that I am reciting and interrupting while passing by stinking passage ways 34b, where, according to the theory of the Babli mentioned above, R. Yoḥanan answers only according to the opinion of those who think that after a longer interruption one has to start anew., do I fulfill my obligation? He answered him: Abbahu my son, if you interrupt enough that you could have finished all of it, you did not fulfill your obligation. Rebbi Eleazar 34b, accepts as the re-interpreted position of Rebbi Yoḥanan. went to pay a sick-bed visit to Rebbi Simeon bar Abba. He said to him: Since I am weak, when I am reciting I tend to slumber; do I fulfill my obligation? He said to him: yes. Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Zeïra: Did Rebbi Eleazar give this ruling since he knew that Rebbi Simeon bar Abba is very scrupulous in the execution of his religious duties, or because he was so weak? He answered him: They disagree explicitly; Rebbi Eleazar said he fulfilled his obligation, Rebbi Yoḥanan said he did not fulfill his obligation. They disagree for the recitation of since that is composed of separate chapters, but for the recitation of and the Esther scroll, Rebbi Eleazar will agree. It was stated: If someone wants to greet his teacher or anybody who his greater than himself in Torah, he is permitted to do so. That implies that a person has to greet anybody who is greater than himself in Torah. And also from the following is found in Babli 87a. A person stands at the deathbed of someone for whom he would be required to mourn. He must tear his clothes after the person’s death. In the case discussed here, he tore his clothes, thinking that the patient was dead but then the dying person showed signs of life. If the final death occurs within the time needed for “speech”, the first tear is sufficient. The is quoted here only to introduce the standard for greeting, which is that the student is required to say: “Peace be with you, my teacher.” This is the standard of behavior for a student.: If one tore his clothes and the soul returned, if it is instantaneous he does not have to tear again. If it is later, he has to tear again. How much is instantaneous? The time for speech. How much is time of speech? Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said: the time one needs to greet his friend 73b), no names are given but it is stated that there are two measurements of “speech”, one from teacher to student, the same as a person to a friend, and the longer one from student to teacher.. Abba bar bar Ḥana in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: the time for greeting between teacher and student, when he says “Peace be with you, my teacher.) has the longer sentence שלום עליך מורי ורבי, “peace be with you, my instructor and teacher.”” Rebbi Yoḥanan was leaning on Rebbi Jacob bar Idi when Rebbi Eleazar saw him and hid himself before him. He said, these two things the Babylonian does to me: First, that he does not greet me, and second, that he does not teach the traditions in my name. He said to him, thus they behave among themselves; Zeïra did not greet Rabba since they observe ( 29:8) “Boys see me and hide themselves.” As they were walking, he saw a . He said to him: Here Rebbi Meïr sat and reported traditions in the name of Rebbi Ismaël but he never reported traditions in the name of Rebbi Aqiba. He answered: Everybody knows that Rebbi Meïr was the student of Rebbi Aqiba. He retorted, everybody knows that Rebbi Eleazar is the student of Rebbi Yoḥanan. May one pass by a cursed 2:6, 3:2, the word is ארורי “cursed”. statue? He 3:8. said to him, do you want to honor it? Pass it by and blind its eyes! He said to him, Rebbi Eleazar did well that he did not pass before you. He said: Rebbi Jacob bar Idi, you know how to pacify. But Rebbi Yoḥanan required that traditions should be reported in his name. Also David begged for divine mercy in this respect, ( 61:5) “may I dwell in Your tent forever!” Rebbi Phineas, Rebbi Jeremiah, in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan; Could David think of living forever? Rather, David meant: May I have the merit that my words will be mentioned in my name in synagogues and houses of study. What good does that do to him? Levi, the son of the 96b, 90b, 31b) the statement is R. Yoḥanan’s in the name of R. Simeon (either ben Yoḥai or ben Yehoẓadaq) and the verse is quoted in the name of several authors, one of them Simeon Nazira who probably was the father of Levi, the son of the who is quoted here. (The may not cut his hair, drink wine, or become impure by a dead body. Since the destruction of the Temple, any vow of is permanent.) said: If someone mentions a tradition in the name of its author, the latter’s lips whisper with him in the grave. What is the reason? (. 7:10) “Dripping from the lips of the sleeping ones.” Like that bunch of grapes which drips by itself. Rebbi Ḥanina bar Pappai. (“Spiced wine” from Latin “condiment, spice.”) and Rebbi Simon, one said, like one who drinks spiced wine, the other said, like one who drinks old wine, even though he consumed it, its taste remains in his mouth. There is no generation without scoffers. What did the hooligans of that generation do? They went to David’s windows and said to him: David, when will the Temple be built, when will we go to the Lord’s house? But he said, even though they intend to enrage me, it comes over me that I am happy, ( 122:1) “I enjoy it when they say to me: let us go to the Lord’s house.” ( 7:12) “; the quote starts with the second word. When your days will be complete”; Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥmani said, the Holy One, praise to Him, said to David: ‘I am counting full days for you, I am not counting missing days for you 23:26, that the Just will live complete years; as in fact Moses died on his 120th birthday. It is asserted here that David also lived complete years; his age is never indicated in .. Will not your son Solomon build the Temple to sacrifice? Law and justice that you are upholding is more to my liking than sacrifices.’ What is the reason? ( 21:3) “Upholding justice and law is preferred by the Lord to sacrifice”. New Section. “Between the sections one greets people out of respect, and answers them.” that one may answer”, they seem to assume that it is obvious that the rules of answering cannot be stricter than those for starting. Also, the Babli takes the two parts together; it is possible that the unnecessary length in the statement of Rebbi Meïr is considered simply as a parallel to the necessary length of the statement of Rebbi Yehudah while for the Yerushalmi the two parallel statements of Rebbi Meïr represent two parallel problems which have to be solved separately. Hence the seemingly repetitous arrangement of the Yerushalmi here; but the first quote of Rebbi Meïr is in support of an argument while the second one presents the topic for further discussion; the two quotes of the identical text are of different status. Why does one answer, out of fear or to show respect? We may hear it from this: “In the middle of a section one may greet because of fear and answer (for respect), the words of Rebbi Meïr.” Hence, in the prior case one may ask because of respect and answer out of respect. “In the middle of a section one may greet because of fear and answer, the words of Rebbi Meïr.” For what does one answer, out of fear or to show respect? We may hear it from this: “Rebbi Yehudah says: in the middle of a section one may greet out of fear and answer for respect.” Hence, in the first case one asks because of fear and answers because of fear. So far in the middle of a section. Or even in the middle of a verse? Rebbi Jeremiah gave hints Chap. 2 and the authorities depending on him (Rashba and Rosh on Babli 14a), the text reads מרמז. The meaning is in both cases that Rebbi Jeremiah did not talk but give greetings or instructions by pantomime.. Rebbi Jonah made himself understood. Rebbi Ḥuna, Rav Joseph: ( 6:7) “You may talk them”, from here that one is authorized to talk between them is translated “you must talk about them” (The Divine commandments), but Rebbi Ḥuna takes it to mean “you may talk in them”, i. e., while reciting the verses..",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: The following are “between the sections”: between the first benediction and the second, between the second and between and ( 11:13) “it shall be when you will really listen”, between “it shall be when you will really listen” and ( 15:37) “the Eternal spoke”. Between “the Eternal spoke” and “true and outstanding starting with a series of epithets of the Torah.”. Rebbi Yehudah said, between “the Eternal spoke” and “true and outstanding” one may not interrupt. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Levi said and “true”. Hence, the question asked in the Babli, whether after reciting “the Eternal, your God. True!” one stops and starts again “true and outstanding”, is irrelevant for the Yerushalmi. The question in the Babli is whether Rebbi Yehudah disagrees with the first Tanna in principle, that ‘between “the Eternal spoke” and “true and outstanding” ’ there is no interruption allowed or whether he simply moves the end of technical by one word and then allows the regular interruptions there., the reason of Rebbi Yehudah: ( 15:41) “I am the Eternal, your God.”, and it is written ( 10:10) “But the Eternal is the true God”.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Ribbi Joshua ben Qorḥah the entire day in the Land of Israel was not unheard-of. said: Why does precede “it shall be when you will really listen”? In order that one should accept the Kingdom of Heaven before he accepts the yoke of the commandments. And “it shall be when you will really listen” to “The Eternal said”? Because “it shall be when you will really listen” is applicable day and night on one’s garment, expressed in the third section of is applicable only during daytime according to most opinions., “the Eternal said” is applicable only during daytime. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Why did they say, a man puts on , recites the and prays? So that he first should accept upon himself the Kingdom of Heaven completely. Rav said, one reads the puts on , and prays on one’s garment, expressed in the third section of is applicable only during daytime according to most opinions.. A of Rav himself, tannaïtic statements not made part of the Mishnah. disagrees with him: “If somebody was occupied with a dead person in his grave and the time for the recital of arrived, he should move to a pure place that praying in a graveyard would violate the verse ( 17:5): “He who makes fun of the poor blasphemes his Maker”; hence one has to leave the graveyard if he wants to pray. The order of prayer given in the is the one adopted by Rebbi Yoḥanan., put on , recite the and pray”. Does not the Mishnah support Rav: “In order that one should accept the Kingdom of Heaven before he accepts the yoke of the commandments”, while mentioned in the first paragraph, belong to the execution of commandments. It follows that, in the opinion of the Yerushalmi, Rav recommended to put on between the first and second sections of ; otherwise, the Mishnah would not support his position. This contradicts the opinion of the Babli as quoted above; it eliminates the objection of the Babli that certainly Rav would not put off fulfilling the obligation of until after the recital of .? Rebbi Yannai said: need a clean body 49a, 130a); there Abbai and Rava explain that one may not break wind while wearing and so may not sleep while wearing them. The Yerushalmi does not go into details. The connection with the previous text probably is the quote that one may not wear in a graveyard. This also counts as having an unclean body since on leaving the graveyard one has to wash his hands. A Mishnah in the next Chapter also implies that one may not wear when his body is not cleansed from an emission of semen. Some Medieval authorities imply from the statement of R. Yannai that while wearing one may not have unclean thoughts.. Why does one not hold on the entire day but takes them off after praying? Tosaphot [ 49a] explain: Why does one not consider a person wearing automatically as a trustworthy Jew who may be trusted to keep all ? The explanation of Tosaphot is easier to fit into our text but the explanation of Rabbenu Yeruḥam seems to have the correct historical background. Both the Roman and the Byzantine governments from time to time forbade the wearing of . Therefore, from the start of the reconstruction of Jewish life after the war of Bar Kokhba, were not worn publicly in the Land of Israel. The reading of the Rome manuscript, “Why does one not hold on to them in the Land of Israel?” seems to explain the situation from a Babylonian point of view where never were a problem with the government and where, in R. Sherira Gaon’s time at least, were worn by scholars all day long. But even in Babylonia in the first generations of Amoraïm Rav Sheshet is reported (Babli 118b) of being proud that he wore the entire day, not just for a minimal time. to them? Because of the impostors outside of times of prayer may make a person suspect of being a gangster impersonating a pious person.. It happened that a man deposited something with another, and the latter then reneged on it. He said to him: Not you I thought trustworthy but those on your head I thought trustworthy. Rebbi Yannai was wearing them after his sickness for three days, to show that sickness cleanses is a body cleansed from sinful thoughts, since a person recovered from sickness is a person all whose sins have been forgiven. It is spelled out in 103 that the first three days, R. Yannai wore his the entire day but after that he was putting them on only for prayer.. What is the reason? ( 103:2): “He Who forgives all my sins, He Who heals all my sicknesses.” Rebbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s were not coming off from him either in summer or in winter. And so did his student Rebbi Eliezer after him. the entire day in the Land of Israel was not unheard-of. Rebbi Yoḥanan was wearing both of them. in winter when his head was healthy. But in sommer when his head was not healthy he put on only that of the arm. But is not that forbidden because of nakedness on the arm are worn under the coat or shirt, there is the possibility that no garment separates the holy from his genitals and that is forbidden as we shall see later. [Only in recent times have become so large that they cannot be covered by the coat sleeves and the bad habit of praying with the left arm uncovered has taken over Ashkenazic congregations.]? Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: He wore an undershirt under his clothes. When he went to bathe, he was taking them off when he came to the oil sellers.. Rebbi Isaac said, he was wearing them up to Jacob, the bath master only into the hands of a reliable Jewish man.. When he exited the bath, they brought them to him. When they were bringing them, he used to say: appears several times: Tosephta 4:7, 1, Babli 13a. The Hebrew verb קנתר, a few times also קנטר, is probably from Greek κεντρόω “to sting, vex, goad”. Two caskets were travelling with Israel in the wilderness, the ark of Him, Who is the Life of the Universe, and the casket of Joseph. The Gentiles were saying: What is the purpose of these two caskets? Israel was answering them, that is the casket of Joseph with the ark of Him, Who is the Life of the Universe. The Gentiles were taunting Israel and saying, how is it possible that the casket of a dead person is travelling with the ark of Him, Who is the Life of the Universe? But Israel were answering, because this one kept all that is written in that one. Why did he say that? Rebbi Ḥanania said, in order to speak some words of learning. Rebbi Mana said to him: Did he have no other word of learning to say but that? But that was sarcasm, to say that Joseph did only attain kingdom by keeping the commandments of the Holy One, praise to Him, and we received all that glory only because we kept the commandments of the Holy One, praise to Him, but you want to remove His commandments from us! How does one make the benedictions on them? Rebbi Zeriqan in the name of Rebbi Jacob ben Rebbi Idi: When he puts on his arm, what does he say: 60b, 36a) the order of the first two benedictions is inverted; the third benediction never was recited in Babylonia (Babli 44b). There is a disagreement in principle between the two Talmudim. It is clear that the Yerushalmi requires two separate benedictions for the two ; therefore, the second one which completes the action is the important and complete one. In the Babli ( 36a) it seems that if both are put on together then only one benediction is needed; the first benediction is the one that counts and has to be recited. [This is Sephardic and Oriental practice today; Ashkenazim recite the second benediction, which is strictly required only if no are available for one’s arm, out of doubt about the situation. In any case, in the Babylonian style, the second benediction is the minor one. Ashkenazic practice is an uneasy adaptation of Yerushalmi practice to Babylonian rules.] “Praised Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us about the obligation of .” When he puts them on his head, what does he say? “Praised Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us about the obligation of putting on .” When he takes them off, what does he say? “Praised Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us to obey His laws.” That follows the opinion that the verse 13:10. In that chapter, verses 1–8 speak of the laws of Passover, v. 9 introduces the commandment of . V. 10, the last in that paragraph, reads: “You shall keep this law in its time, מימים ימימה.” If the “law” is that of one has to translate “from day to day”, meaning that at nighttime the law is either inoperative or that it is forbidden to wear If the “law” is that of Passover, one has to translate “from year to year.” The latter meaning is the usual one for the Hebrew expression, but then it would have been rational to expect that verses 9 and 10 traded places. The Yerushalmi refrains from attaching names to the different interpretations. In the Babylonian Talmud ( 96a), the first interpretation is that of R. Yose the Galilean, the second one that of R. Aqiba. In the Yerushalmi source (p. 41), the first interpretation is that of R. Aqiba and the second one of R. Eliezer. Since R. Aqiba belongs to the following generation, the basic disagreement can be attributed to Rebbis Yose the Galilean and Eliezer. speaks about the law of . However, according to those who say that the verse speaks about the law of Passover, that does not apply. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: He who puts on in the night transgresses a positive commandment. What is the reason? ( 13:10) “ “You shall keep this law in its time, from day to day;” “days” not night, “to days” to exclude Sabbaths and holidays. But Rebbi Abbahu sat studying at night with his on his head! He put them on the side, as holy objects, have to be deposited in safe places.; they were like a deposit in his keeping. Some want to say, he only meant not to put them on, but when they were on him during daytime it would be permitted. Some want to say, let us hear it from there ( 13:9): “It shall be for you a sign,” when you need it for a sign, but not holiday or Sabbaths that are all sign. But is it not written “to days”? You have only what Rebbi Yoḥanan said: Everything that is not clear one supports from many places 13:10 may apply to Passover, any derivation from that verse is not clear. In , the first derivation is anonymous, the second one is attributed to Rebbi Aqiba. While the discussion here is of Amoraïm, the entire material is tannaïtic.. Women from where? ( 11:19) “And you should teach them to your sons”, and not to your daughters. Anyone who is obliged to study Torah is obliged for , women who are not obliged to study Torah are not obliged for ., is really from 13:9: “It shall be a sign on your hand and a remembrance between your eyes, , because with a strong hand the Eternal led you out of Egypt.” Hence, only one who is obliged to study is obliged to wear . Naturally, for those who declare that 13:10 speaks of and nights are not a time for , it follows that is a positive commandment bound to stated times and, as a general principle, women are not obligated. However, since that interpretation of v. 10 is in doubt, it is not used here. They objected, but did not Michal, the daughter of the Kushi, wear , and did not the wife of Jonah make the pilgrimage to the Temple, and the sages did not object. Rebbi Ḥisqiah in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: Jonah’s wife was turned back, the sages forbade it to Michal the daughter of Kushi. and that the wife of Jonah made the pilgrimage, is a tannaïtic statement in the Babli ( 96a), and the Babli concludes from it that women exercise all obligations that are bound to a fixed time from which women are freed. The Yerushalmi Amoraïm and later Yerushalmi sources ( Chap. 22) disagree. This disagreement is not mentioned in the Babli; i. e., the argument is rejected. It was stated 2:20; a slightly different version is Babli 10a. One returns to the problem discussed earlier that , as objects of holiness, cannot be worn on an arm that is not separated from one’s genitals by some clothing. Hence, cannot be worn when one is naked, or in the presence of naked people. Prayer and religious study go by the same rules, following the verse ( 4:12) “Israel, prepare yourself for your God”.: “Entering a bathhouse, in the room where everybody is fully clothed, and putting on one’s clothes. The outer rooms were used for social affairs, especially in large cities. one may read the Bible, pray”; but these are separately mentioned later., and needless to say, one may greet people 6:24; hence, greeting somebody with שָּׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם is permitted only under circumstances that would allow prayer. The prohibition does not include greetings in other languages if the name of God is not invoked.. One may put on , and needless to say, one does not remove them. In the room where most people are naked one may not exchange greetings and needless to say, there is no Bible reading or prayer; one removes one’s and needless to say, one does not put them on. Where some are naked and some are clothed there is greeting, no Bible reading and no prayer, one does not remove and one does not put them on. But one does not put them on again until he has completely left the grounds of that bathhouse.” This supports what Rebbi Isaac said about Rebbi Yoḥanan, that he wore them until he came to Jacob, the bath master. Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Zeïra: If it was used as bath house in summer but not in the rainy season, what is the rule? He said to him, a bath house even if it is not in use, a toilet even if it does not contain excrement 26a).. Mar Uqba(Head of the Diaspora) in the time of Rav. The author of the statement is either Rabbana Uqba, grandson of Mar Uqba and Rav, or, more likely, Rav Uqba bar Ḥama, student and son-in-law of Rav Ḥisda. In the Babli (25a), the statement is attributed to Rav Papa, student of Rav Ḥisda’s student Rava (brother-in-law of Rav Uqba bar Ḥama). said: a pig is a moving toilet. Rebbi Jonah investigated: A pebble on the sea shore, what is the rule? Rebbi Ammi the physician said: Rebbi Jeremiah taught that one may pass it by , “bonnet, felt hat”, also Greek πίλινος “of felt”, πιλίον “a bandage” (E. G.). The reading of the Rome manuscript is פיליונס. The word appears as פיליוס in Mishnah 8:1; Rashi there explains the word by old French , a scarf; , in its Italian translation , means a scarf used to cover the mouth. The meaningtherefore is that Rebbi Jeremiah counsels to cover one’s face with a scarf. (Musaphia reads , “coverlet, gown.”), but one does not trust this ruling. Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Abba bar Jeremiah 23b, 41b), the second part of his statement, about sleeping, is introduced as an anonymous tannaitic statement (תנו רבנן).: One may eat a snack while wearing them. A snack is a meal which does not involve bread. The rule about eating is not mentioned in the Babli; hence, the Babli agrees with it., but one may not eat a regular meal while wearing them; one may doze while wearing them, but one may not sleep while wearing them. Some Tannaïm formulate: One says the benediction once; some Tannaïm formulate: One says the benediction twice, R. Zeïra then reports that some Tannaïm require that one recite the benediction over once a day, but some others say that the benediction is recited (at least) two times a day. The objection is that (except for a fast day) one has to eat, hence one has to take off one’s and put them on again, certainly with a benediction. The anwer is that some people eat only snacks during daytime; hence, it is proved that the Tanna agrees with Abba bar Jeremiah that for a snack one does not have to remove his .. He who says one says the benediction once, how can he be right? He who says, one says the benediction twice, because he ate and then they are not on him. Rebbi Zeïra said, Abba bar Jeremiah talks about one who eats only snacks. Rebbi Zeïra in the name of (Rebbi) Abba [bar Jeremiah]: A person should not enter a urinal) wants to identify the “house of water” with a toilet since in Arabic a toilet is called בַּית אַלמַא “house of water”, but L. Ginzburg already noted that this is impossible; in the Yerushalmi as in the Babli a toilet is called בית הכסא. In the Tosephta ( 4:8) it is stated that a king, who has to write for himself a Torah that has to accompany him everywhere ( 17:19), may not take the Torah with him to the “house of water”. This rule is quoted in Babli 21b, in the reading of R. Ḥananel and ms. ק, in the formulation that he takes the Torah with him neither to the bathhouse, nor to the toilet, nor to urinate. Hence, the toilet and the “house of water” are two different things. with his books or in his hands. Rebbi Yoḥanan, when he had a book 23a), a book of sermons. in his hand he gave it to somebody else. When his were on him, he stood in them) reports that Rebbi Yoḥanan put the in a pouch which he kept in his hand, not that he was wearing them. But the Babli does not speak about a urinal (with canalization, after the Roman fashion) but of a toilet, i. e., an outhouse. Roman canalization was unknown in Babylonia. Hence, the seemingly parallel passages in reality deal with different subjects.. A disagrees with Abba bar Jeremiah: A man may enter a urinal with his books or in his hand. Rebbi Zeïra said: Abba bar Jeremiah refers to one case where he can wear them, and to another case where he cannot wear them) in the name of Rebbi Zera (Zeïra). If one takes off the in the evening, when there is not time anymore to put them on afterwards, one must put the in a designated bag or chest so as to treat them with respect. Temporary disrespect is only authorized if have to be ready for immediate use.. For if he cannot perform a with them, why should he degrade them? First they were giving them, when somebody was entering a toilet. In the parallel in the Babli ( 23a), it is not mentioned that first one had to hand the , which represent a considerable monetary worth, to other people. to others; these were taking them and fleeing. They decreed that one should put them in holes in the wall. When that incident): A prostitute found a pair of in a hole near a public toilet, took them, and bragged publicly that she had received them for her services from a certain holy man who then committed suicide as a consequence of the public scandal. happened, they decreed that a person should enter and keep them in his hand. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Zeïra said: but only if there is time left during the day to put them on again. But if there is no time left in the day to put them on, it is forbidden. For if he cannot perform a with them, why should he degrade them? Maisha (Moses), grandson of R. Joshua ben Levi, said: He who wants to do it right, makes for them a pouch the size of a hand-breadth and puts them on his heart in the pouch and carry them hanging under his outer garment, the strap going around his neck. Since one needs the pouch anyhow for storing the during nighttime, the counsel of Rebbi Maishe is only to put the straps on so that the pouch can be used also during daytime. The Babli (24a) forbids expressly to have the hanging on its own straps (not those of a pouch).. What is the reason? ( 16:8): “I put the Eternal always before me.” There 49a) reads: “Rebbi Yannai said: need a clean body, like Elisha of the bird’s wings.” R. Z. Frankel points out that at the start of fol. 4c, the Yerushalmi quotes that “Rebbi Yannai said: need a clean body”; hence, the reference to Elisha of the bird-wings is really a Babylonian addition. The story is told only in the Babli, , that Elisha was wearing when, in the aftermath of the war of Bar Kokhba, wearing was a capital crime. But he took them off when he saw a policeman and kept them in his hands. When the policeman asked him what he held in his hands, he said: “a couple of bird’s wings.” When he was ordered to open his hands, two birds flew away and his life was saved. (This story shows again that cases were not supposed to be larger than about 3/8th of an inch square.) The implication of this Babylonian ruling is that nobody can be expected to keep his body perfectly clean for very long; hence, should be removed after prayers. they say: He who is not like Elisha of the bird’s wings should not put on . Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Abba bar Jeremiah: A person may not enter a cemetery and relieve himself there. When he did it anyway, about him the verse says ( 17:5) “He who makes fun of the poor blasphemes his Maker.” Clarification: The great Rebbi Ḥiyya and Rebbi Jonathan were walking before the bier of Rebbi Simeon bar Yose bar Laqonia when Rebbi Jonathan stepped over his grave. The great Rebbi Ḥiyya said to him: About that they will say, tomorrow they will be with us but they hurt us. He answered him, do they know anything? Is it not written: ( 9:5) “But the dead do not know anything.” He told him: you know how to read, you do not know how to preach. ( 9:5) “The living know that they will die”, these are the Just who even in death are considered living; “but the dead do not know anything;” these are the wicked who even in life are called dead. From where that the wicked even in life are called dead? It is said ( 18:32) “For I have no pleasure in the death of the dead;” how can a dead person die? But these are the wicked who even in life are called dead. And from where that the Just even in death are considered living? It is written ( 34:4) “And He said to him: This is the land I had sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to tell.” Why does the verse say “to tell”? He said to him: go and tell the patriarchs that all I had promised I fulfilled to your descendants after you. If one connected the letters, and Torah scrolls, not about wearing them. The main discussion is in Yerushalmi 1:9; here it is quoted since it is somehow connected with the topic of but mainly because it belongs to a sequence of statements by Rebbi Idi in the name of Rebbi Simeon in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan, which belong to the topic of prayer. The explanation of this paragraph follows the interpretation of (Solomon ben Adrat, , vol. 1, #711). The problem is the legal status of a holy text in which two letters touch one another. The Babli states ( 49a) that every letter must be surrounded by white parchment. The Yerushalmi has no equivalent statement but one may assume that it subscribes to the same standard. It is also required that a letter should be written, not carved out. Hence, if a letter is completely written and its foot accidentally touches the following letter, as with a slightly too long foot of נ in נו, one may scratch off the superfluous length and has a complete acceptable letter. But when a letter has its head elongated, so that from the start the letter was not standing free, then the entire letter has to be scratched out and the writing has to start anew. The questionable case is a situation with a letter that is hanging down below the line, as in the combination תך when the small foot of ת meets the downward stroke of ך. In that case, the ת was complete but the ך was not; this case remains unsettled (i. e., for practical rulings both letters have to be erased and rewritten.); there is a Tanna who stated: it is valid, and there is a Tanna who stated: it is invalid. Rebbi Idi in the name of Rebbi Simeon in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: He who says it is valid, below; he who said it is invalid, on top. For example, ארצך .ארצנו, תפארתנוּ is questionable, תפארתך is questionable. Rebbi Idi in the name of Rebbi Simeon in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan 1:9 and in the Rome ms. here. The parallel in the Babli ( 10) is aatributed to Rebbi Yose ben R. Ḥanina in the name of the Tanna Rebbi Eliëzer ben Jacob. Venice print: ר׳ אידי בר׳ שמעון בשם ר׳ יוסה.: No man should stand at an elevated place and pray. What is the reason? Rebbi Abba the son of R. Pappai Pappai”; the Galilean Amora Rebbi Abba lived a generation before the Babylonian Amora Rav Pappi, one of the successors of Rava. said: ( 130:1) “From the depth I call on You, o Eternal!” Rebbi Idi in the name of Rebbi Simeon in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan said: No man should pray when he has an urge to go to the bathroom 23a) this appears as a statement of R. Samuel ben Naḥmani in the name of Rebbi Jonathan. It is really a Tosephta ( 2:18).. What is the reason? ( 4:12) “Prepare yourself before Your God, o Israel!” Rebbi Alexandri said: ( 4:17) “Watch you feet when you go to God’s house”; watch yourself from the drops that drip from between your feet. That means, for urine. But for defecation, if he can bear it, let him bear it without going to the bathroom (about a 70 minutes’ walk).. Rebbi Jacob bar Abbai) this is also a statement of R. Samuel bar Naḥmani in the name of Rebbi Jonathan, i. e., of the first generations of Israeli Amoraïm. in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: ( 4:17) “Watch you feet when you go to God’s house”; watch yourself when you are called to God’s house that you should be pure and innocent. Rebbi Abba said: ( 5:18) “Your fountain shall be blessed”, your being called to the grave shall be blessed. Rebbi Berekhiah said ( 3:1): “A time to be born and a time to die”, hail to the man whose hour of death is like the hour of his birth; just as at the hour of his birth he was innocent so at the hour of his death may he be innocent.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who recited the and did not make his ear hear, (Rebbi Yehudah says that) that the editors of the Yerushalmi did not read the words in parenthesis and, maybe, considered the full text as a . A similar instance appears in the Babli (15a) where the Mishnah is presented in this form: He who recited the and did not make his ear hear has fulfilled his obligation, and the Gemara two lines later treats this as anonymous statement, but five lines further down quotes the Mishnah (דתנן) as: ‘He who recited the and did not make his ear hear has fulfilled his obligation, these are the words of Rebbi Yehudah.’ One of the editors of 18th Cent. editions of the Talmud, R. Joel Sirkes known as , wants to cross out the last part of the quote, but the Yerushalmi shows that two versions of the Mishnah did exist and, since it is impossible to write two versions at the same place, one is quoted as a separate Mishnah and the other in the text. he has fulfilled his obligation, Rebbi Yose says that he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he recited and was not exact in its letters, Rebbi Yose says that he has fulfilled his obligation, Rebbi Yehudah says that he has not fulfilled his obligation. He who reads backwards has not fulfilled his obligation. If he recited and made a mistake then he should return to the place of the mistake. HALAKHAH: Rav said: practice follows both of them for leniency 15b), this is a statement of Rebbi Ṭabi in the name of Rebbi Josiah; the latter was a student of Rebbi Yoḥanan. The statement in the Babli is accepted without discussion because, as Rav Haï Gaon points out in his commentary, the Talmud previously did establish that the first statement is Rebbi Yehudah’s and, therefore, the question asked in the Yerushalmi has no place in the Babli. One may assume that the fact that the ruling is attributed to a Babylonian in the Yerushalmi and to a Galilean in the Babli is intentional, to show that this is the universally accepted practice [necessary, because in general borrowing leniencies from opposing points of view is frowned upon.]. If it were not so, what could one say? An anonymous statement and Rebbi Yose, practice follows the anonymous. Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Yehudah, practice follows Rebbi Yose 46b. It follows that the statement of Rav seems superfluous.. So why does Rav have to say, practice follows both of them for leniency? Because he had heard Rebbi Ḥiyya formulating it in the name of Rebbi Meïr), Rebbi Meïr states that the obligation of reciting “is in the mind”; this implies that one does not have to hear what he himself is saying. Since the Mishnah or an equivalent is never quoted in the name of Rebbi Meïr, R. Zachariah Frankel wants to correct “Rebbi Meïr” to “Rebbi Yehudah” and considers the second version of the Mishnah in both Talmudim as the Mishnah of Rebbi Ḥiyya, in contrast to the Mishnah of Rebbi that is formulated anonymously. However, there is no textual support for such a theory. Practice follows Rebbi Yose even against Rebbi Meïr; hence, the statement of Rav is necessary for the first part of the Mishnah., he has to say that practice follows both of them for leniency. It was stated: “He who did pray prayer. and did not make his ear hear did fulfill his obligation.” For whom do we need that? For Rebbi Yose! For which statement of Rebbi Yose? For that which we have stated: “He who recites the and did not make his ear hear has fulfilled his obligation, Rebbi Yose says that he has not fulfilled his obligation.” Rav Mattanah 2:4: “The insane, the deaf and dumb, and minors cannot read the (for others)”. Rav Mattanah notes that, obviously, one does not mean a deaf and dumb person who cannot talk, but a deaf person who cannot hear. Since the Mishnah is anonymous, it must be the consensus of the Sages that one cannot fulfill the obligation of reading the if one does not hear what he himself is saying. Hence, the general consensus in is identical with the opinion of Rebbi Yose in . The practice, therefore, should follow Rebbi Yose for stringency, in contrast to Rav’s statement in the preceding paragraph. said: That formulation is Rebbi Yose’s. Rebbi Yose said: We could be of the opinion that the rabbis and Rebbi Yose disagree only about since there it is written: “hear!”, but not about any other obligations. Since Rav Mattanah said “that formulation is Rebbi Yose’s”, it is the same for all obligations. What is the reason of Rebbi Yose? ( 15:26) “Bend your ear to His commandments”, your ears should hear what your mouth says. Rav Ḥisda said: The deaf and dumb person is not mentioned, it is a formula. may well be Rebbi Yehudah’s. Then the Mishnah might be Rebbi Yehudah’s. Rebbi Yose said: It is reasonable to think that Rav Ḥisda concedes that the statement from is from Rebbi Yose, the heave, is the first gift of grain to the Cohen from the new harvest. There is no amount fixed for in the Pentateuch; it must be consecrated explicitly. Only a person of sound mind can consecrate . The first Mishnah in tractate reads: “Five categories of people cannot consecrate and if they did it anyhow, their actions are null and void: the deaf and dumb, the insane, minors, one who is not the owner, and a non-Jew.” The sixth Mishnah then reads: “Five categories of people should not consecrate (since it requires the recitation of a benediction) but if they did it anyhow their actions are valid: the speechless, the drunk, the naked, the blind, those impure by emission of semen.” In between it is explained that חרש means a deaf and dumb person who is not legally capable of acting but that the deaf who can talk belongs to the same category as the second group of five.. Rabbi Ḥanina said in the name of Rav Ḥisda, this one is by Rebbi Yose. Rebbi Yose bar Rebbi Abun said: It must be said that that one is Rebbi Yose’s since we have stated the first five cases and did not include it, because their is no . Then we have stated the five later ones and did not include it. So in the end you must say, that one is by Rebbi Yose, explaining that the deaf who is able to speak can give , has to be formulated separately and could not be included in the sixth Mishnah since the first and sixths Mishnayot are Rebbi Yose’s who will object to the inclusion of the deaf-but-not-speechless in the second group.. These need careful attention: , , , , , 15b) this list is an appendix by Rava to a stating that in reciting the one has to differentiate between identical sounds. There is no problem with the words in where final and initial 1 and m clash. More of a problem is the clash of soft and hard ב, פ. The late Prof. Y. Kutscher pointed out that in classical Arabic there is a tendency to pronounce fb as bb [, Journal of Semitic Studies 10(1965) pp. 21–51, see p. 30] but it seems clear at least for ב which, under the influence of the Greek that was the common vernacular, in Galilee both ב and בּ were pronounced “v”. For example, the technical term מחוור “logically consistent” in the Babli appears as מְחוּבָּר “connected” in Yerushalmi 2:1, fol.l6d. It does not make any sense to derive מחוור from Aramaic חוור “pale”. Hence, Galilean מחבר sounded מחוור in Babylonian ears. (Possibly both ב and בּ were pronounced as “b” in Babylonia, as they still are today in dialects of Jews from Arabic speaking countries.) It is less certain but still possible that פ was pronounced “p-h” rather than “f”.. Rebbi Ḥanina in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: . Rebbi Samuel bar Ḥanina in the name of Rebbi Hoshaiah: “He Who forms light and creates darkness, it appears here in the context of the recitation of . The language is that of the verse ( 45:7) “He Who forms light and creates darkness, makes peace and creates evil.” In prayer, the verse is changed to “He Who forms light and creates darkness, makes peace and creates all” to soften the language. Rebbi Hoshaiah notes that one may not go so far as to eliminate the mention of darkness, in the words of the Babli (12a) “to mention night at day and day at night”, to negate any Zoroastrian dualism.”; one should not say: “He Who forms light and creates radiance.” Rebbi Ḥaggai in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Zavda: “There they sang for You: “We thank You that You took us out of Egypt and redeemed us from the house of slavery to thank Your Name”. The Babli (14b) has the corresponding Galilean version: “We thank You that You took us out of Egypt and redeemed us from the house of slavery, did for us wonders and great deeds on the sea, and we sang for You”. The version “There they praised You” seems to be an alternative Babylonian form that is rejected here (since it is not a proper introduction to the required recitation of 15:11,19. In later times, the Israeli standard introduction to these verses was בגילה ברנה בשמחה רבה ואמרו כולם, retained in the Ashkenazic service on holiday nights.)”, one should not say: “There they praised You”. Rebbi Levi, Rebbi Eudaimon of Haifa, in the name of Rebbi Levi bar Sisi: one has to pronounce voiced 15:40) “you shall remember” and תסכרו “you shall dam up”, תשׂכרו “you shall hire”, and even, under the influence of Greek, which knows no sound, תשׁכרו “you will get drunk”.. Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rav Ḥisda: one has to pronounce voiced R. Zachariah Frankel notes that the two Aramaic verbs חֲסַד “to be loving” and חַסַּד “to insult, degrade” differ in the quality of its sound; hence, one has to take care that “truly, His kindness is forever” should not sound as “truly, His insulting is forever”. It seems that while should not really sound like , care has to be taken not to make it sound like . Maybe the same difference was once heard between Hebrew חסד I “to show kindness” and חסד II “to insult.”. It was stated: One does not take as reader anyone from Haifa, Beth Sheän or Tiv‘on since they read ח like until the middle of the sixteenth Century. Under the influence of Polish, which in contrast to German has only one - sound, Ashkenazic pronunciation lost the difference between ח () and כ (). In all other Jewish dialects, the problem is not the identification of כ,ח but of ע . ח,ה is lost in all Ashkenazic pronunciations; it is retained in Italian and Portuguese Hebrew as .ה and ע like א. If his pronunciation was orderly, it would be permitted. New Section.He who reads backwards has not fulfilled his obligation. Rebbi Jonah said that Rav Naḥman bar Ada stated, Rebbi Yose said that Naḥman the Old stated, ( 6:6) “They shall be”, they shall be unaltered. We have stated: The same holds for and the reading of the Esther scroll. This is fine for the Esther scroll since it is written there ( 9:27): “As they are written” and it its time, every single year.” Hence, the scroll must be read as it is written.. But for , since it is written ( 113:3): “From sunrise to sunset, may the name of the Eternal be praised?” What can you understand from that? Rebbi Abun said: It also is written in order. ( 114:1) “When Israel left Egypt” in the past. ( 115:1) “Not for us, o Eternal, not for us” in the present 118a), this sentence is applied by Rebbi Yoḥanan either to the oppression by hostile governments or to the sufferings preceding the coming of the Messiah. That may be the meaning of the sentence here also. Alternatively, the psalm is interpreted there as the song of Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah in the fiery oven.. ( 116:1) “I loved, truly the Eternal listened to my voice” in the days of the Messiah. ( 118:27) “Bind the holiday sacrifice with ropes” in the days of Gog and Magog, 118:24 “This is the day the Eternal made, let us rejoice and be happy on it” is taken to describe the time when one can be sure that the deliverance will not be followed by another oppression.. ( 118:28) “You are my God” in the future world. Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Also he who composed this prayer. Another derivation is given in the following paragraph. composed it in good order. The first three and the last three are the praise of the Omnipresent, the middle ones are the needs of the creatures. Give us knowledge. You gave us knowledge, accept our repentance. You accepted our repentance, forgive us. You forgave us, save us. You saved us, heal our diseases. You healed our diseases, bless our years. You blessed our years, gather us in. You gathered us in, judge us in justice. You judged us in justice, subdue those who arise against us. is an institution of the Men of the Great Assembly, its place was chosen in the spirit of those who first formulated the prayer. You subdued those who arise against us, justify us. You justified us, build Your house, listen to our supplications, be pleased with us in it. Is it necessary after “build Your house,” listen to our supplications, be pleased with us in it? But as the verse is, so is the tradition ( 56:7): “I shall bring them to My holy mountain, make them happy in My house of prayer. 17b–18a.” 17b–18a. Rebbi Jeremiah said: 120 elders, among them more than 80 prophets, instituted this prayer. Why did they follow “the holy God”. What follows is a description of the benedictions of the week-day . by “He Who favors with knowledge”? Because ( 29:23–24) “they sanctify the Holy One of Jacob” is followed by “and those of erring spirit will know insight.” “Knowledge” followed by “Repentance”, ( 6:10) “Makefat the heart of this people, make it hard of hearing and its eyes sticky, that it should not see with its eyes, nor hear with its ears, nor understand with its heart, because if it would repent then it would be healed.” “Repentance” by “Forgiveness”, ( 55:7) “He should return to the Lord that He would have mercy on him, and to our God because He forgives much.” “Forgiveness” by “Redemption”, ( 103:2–3) “He Who forgives all your sins, He Who hears all your maladies, He Who redeems your soul from destruction.” Then he should say “Healer of the sick” before that. Rebbi Aḥa said: why did they institute “Redeemer of Israel” as the seventh benediction? To teach you that Israel will be redeemed only in a Seventh Year) in a Jubilee cycle. The “seventh song” in the next sentence is the seventh of the songs of ascent.. Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: ( 126) “A song of ascent. When the Eternal will return the returnees of Zion” is the seventh song, to show you that Israel will be redeemed only in a Seventh Year. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: Why did they institute “Healer of the sick” as the eighth benediction? That is for circumcision which is done on the eighth, following ( 2:5) “My covenant was with him: Life” Covenant refers to circumcision.. Rebbi Alexander said: Why did they institute “He Who blesses the years” as the ninth benediction? Corresponding to ( 29:5) “The sound of the Eternal breaks cedars”, since in the future He will break all market manipulators 10:15, which in Babylonian (and Rashi’s) count was 9:36 and, therefore, is appropriate for the Ninth benediction. Our texts of Psalms which split an alphabetic acrostich between Psalms 9 and 10 is the Yerushalmi tradition which, therefore, cannot use the verse quoted in the Babli.. Rebbi Levi in the name of Rebbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina: Why did they follow “He Who blesses the years” by “Ingatherer of the dispersed of Israel”? Because of ( 36:8) “you, mountains of Israel, sprout your branches and carry your fruits for my people Israel”, why? “because they will soon come.” When the dispersed are gathered in then justice will be done, the evildoers will succumb, and the just will be happy. It was stated: One includes the apostates and the wicked in “He Who subdues the evildoers”, the converts and the elders in “refuge of the just”, David in “Builder of Jerusalem”. ( 3:5) “Then the children of Israel will repent, seek the Eternal, their God, and their king David.” The Rebbis say: This King Messiah, if he is from the living, his name is David. If he is from the dead, his name is David. Rebbi Tanḥuma said: I am declaring the reason ( 18:51) “He gives kindness to His anointed, to David. 98b, where for the first case a verse in Jeremiah (30:9) is cited: “They shall serve the Eternal, their God, and their king David whom I shall raise for them” which also is written in the future tense. The second case, that the original David will be resurrected as Messiah, is based on a verse in Ezechiel (34:24) “I, the Eternal, shall be for them their God, and My servant David prince in their midst”, seems to refer to the historical David in Messianic times. The Babylonian Talmud points out that a prince is less than a king and, therefore, the new King Messiah will have the status of a Roman Augustus whereas the resurrected David will occupy the position of Caesar, or Crown Prince. In any case, the next paragraph makes is quite clear that the Messiah was born on the day of the destruction of the Temple and that, therefore, nobody with a recorded date of birth can ever be considered as Messiah. There is no reason to believe that the Babli would disagree with this conclusion. In addition, Maimonides in his is quite adamant that the Messiah can only appear in the Land of Israel and must be a political figure.’ Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, his name is Ẓemaḥ. Rebbi Yudan, the son of Rebbi Aivu, said his name is Menaḥem 1(57). The verse of R. Joshua ben Levi is 6:12: “Behold, a man of the name of Ẓemaḥ, he will sprout from below and build the Eternal’s temple.” The verse of Rebbi Yudan is 1:16: “Behold, far from me is Menaḥem who will restore my spirit.”. Ḥanina the son of Rebbi Abbahu said: they have no disagreement since the numerical value of one is the numerical value of the other: Ẓemaḥ is equal to Menaḥem. Since Rebbi Yudan the son of Rebbi Aivu said, it happened to a Jew who was plowing in the valley of Arbel that his ox was bellowing. An Arab passed by and heard the bellowing of the ox. He said to him: Jew, Jew, unharness your ox, unharness your plow “small vessel”. However, this קנקן appears several times also in the Babli (noted in the Rabbinic dictionary under קנקן ב׳) and seems to mean the central peg by which the motion of the plow is controlled; possibly from old Persian , “plow”. because the Temple was destroyed. The ox bellowed a second time. He said: Jew, Jew, harness your ox, fix your plow because King Messiah has been born. He said to him: What is his name? Menaḥem. He said to him: What is his father’s name? Ḥizqiah. He said to him: Where is he? He said to him: At the king’s palace in Bethlehem in Judea. He went and sold his ox and plow and made himself a vendor of baby linens. He went to towns and left towns until he came to that town. All the women bought from him but the mother of Menaḥem did not buy. He heard the women say: Menaḥem’s mother, Menaḥem’s mother, come and buy for your son! She said: I would rather strangle him like a hater of Israel because he was born on the day the Temple was destroyed. He said to her: I like him, because for him it was destroyed and for him it will be rebuilt. She said to him, I have no money. He said to her, that does not bother me, come and buy for him! If you have nothing with you today, I shall return another day and I will take it then. After some time he went up to that town and said to her: How is your baby doing? She said to him: After you had seen me there came storms and raised him and tore him from my hands (II, 7b–8b) improves on the story and asserts that the Messiah is living in Paradise at a place known as “bird’s nest”.. Rebbi Abun said: We do not need to learn from that Arab, is it not a full verse ( 10:35): “The Lebanon will fall through a noble one”? 3:25, where Moses begs to see “this good mountain and the Lebanon.” Since God later showed Moses all he wanted to see, but nothing North of the city of Dan, it follows that “Lebanon” here cannot mean the mountain range. The verse here was used by Rabban Joḥanan ben Zakkai to predict to Vespasian that he would be emperor before he could conquer Jerusalem because the Temple could fall only to a noble one ( 1(32)). In Isaiah, the verse is the introduction to a description of Messianic times. And the next verse is (11:1) “A sprout will come from the stem of Jesse.” Rebbi Tanḥuma said: Why did they institute “He Who listens to prayer” as the fifteenth benediction? Corresponding to ( 29:10) “The Eternal throned over the Deluge”, that He avert the catastrophy, that it should not come over the world. Temple service (precedes) Thanksgiving. The 16th (Israeli count) prays for restoration of the Temple service and acceptance of our prayer as if performed in the Temple. The 17th benediction is Thanksgiving, the 18th is for Peace, following (in the Morning Service) the Priestly Blessings that end in “peace”.: ( 50:23) “He who brings a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me and shows a path; I shall make him see God’s help.” One finishes with Peace, since all benedictions end with peace. Rebbi Simeon bar Ḥalaphta 3:12). said: There is no vessel that contains more blessing than peace. What is the reason? ( 29:11) “The Eternal gives strength to His people, the Eternal blesses His people with peace.” “If he recited and made a mistake then he should return to the place of the mistake.” 16a. If he made a mistake between the first and second mention of “writing” he must return to the first “writing” 6:9, 11:20, read: “You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and your gates.” Since the verses are identical, a person who recited mechanically has no way of deciding between the two but must start anew from the first verse.. If he made a mistake and does not know where he made the mistake, he returns to the start, to any place that he is sure about 2:5) that one has to return to the start of the section he remembers. Since the language from the start of the paragraph to here is in pure Hebrew, it probably represents an Israeli version of that Tosephta.. An explanation: Rebbi Ḥiyya, Rebbi Yasa, Rebbi Ammi were preparing the wedding canopy, (n., plur.) “marriage bed, marriage” (E. G.). Rebbi Ḥiyya mentioned here is R. Ḥiyya bar Abba; his name is missing in the Babli. for Rebbi Eleazar. They heard the voice of Rebbi Joḥanan when he explained something new. They said: Who is going down to hear that from him? They said, let Rebbi Eleazar go down since he is very careful. He descended, ascended, and said to them: So says Rebbi Joḥanan, if he recited and found himself at למען one can be sure that he had the right intention. Rebbi Lia, Rebbi Yasa in the name of the great Rebbi Aḥa: If he prayed and he found himself in “He Who hears prayer”, he may assume that he prayed with intent is a long prayer, it is probable that he lost concentration on what he was saying somewhere in between but when he realizes that he recited the last of the intermediary benedictions he may assume that he said all others in the required order.. Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: If he prayed without intent and he knows that the second time he will pray with intent, he may pray a second time; otherwise he should not pray 34b, a statement of Rebbi Ḥiyya (bar Abba) in the name of the Babylonian Rav Safra] requires total concentration only during the first benediction; hence, for the Babli someone who did not concentrate during the first benediction has to repeat the . {In the (Sec. 101,1), R. Josef Qaro follows the Babli but R. Moshe Isserles decides Ashkenazic practice according to the Yerushalmi.]. The great Rebbi Ḥiyya said: I never managed to pray with intent, but one time I made an effort to concentrate and I started to think and said to myself, who enters first before the king, the ἀργαπέτης “citadel”, پد (old Persian ) “master, overseer”. So the title seems to designate the person who overseas the royal castle (Fleischer) or “commandant of a fort” (Liddell &amp; Scott). or the ? Samuel said: I counted chicks.. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said: I counted stone rows. Rebbi Mattaniah said: I an thankful to my head that when I come to it bends down by itself.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Professional workers read; since this recitation needs concentration only for the first verse, we may assume that the professional can concentrate for that short time span without fear of falling down. The rest of can be recited by rote from memory. In contrast, prayer (the ) needs concentration from beginning to end and can be recited only on the ground. on top of a tree or on top of a wall in construction; they are not permitted to do this for prayer. HALAKHAH: So read כיני as given here. is the Mishnah: The hourly workers read on top of a tree and the professionals on top of a wall in construction. It was stated 2:8: “Hourly workers read on top of a tree and on top of a wall in construction; they pray on top of an olive tree and a fig tree but for all other trees they have to descend and pray. The owner descends in any case for prayer. “A similar text, only with “professionals” instead of “hourly workers”. is quoted in Babli 16a.: “They pray on top of an olive tree or on top of a fig tree.” Hence, on all other trees he descends and prays on the ground. “The owner descends in all cases and prays on the ground.” And why on top of an olive tree or on top of a fig tree? Rebbi Abba and Rebbi Simon say both, because those are very laborious. It was stated( 2:7) where, however, the exemption for the carrier of a large load is not mentioned.: “The porter may recite the even with his load on his shoulders, the porter is mentioned before the worker. but he should start neither when he unloads nor when he loads because he cannot then concentrate. In any case he may not pray until he unloads, but if he was carrying a load of 4 is 4 , about 2.17 liters. 4 are a Roman , about a British peck, a fourth of a bushel. The Babli, 105b, quotes a which states that the porter may pray with his load if the load is less than 4 , but not if the load is 4 or more. Therefore, it seems that in the Yerushalmi the meaning is that the porter may pray without unloading if his load does not exceed 4 , on condition that it be balanced. The two differences between Yerushalmi and Babylonian practice are that for the Babli, the load has to be strictly less than 4 , for the Yerushalmi it may reach 4 , and for the Babli the load has to be all on the back and not distributed fore and aft. it is permitted.” Rebbi Joḥanan said: only if he is in equilibrium. What means that he is in equilibrium? Two parts on his back and one part in front. It was stated is given in the Babli, 19b, in the name of the early Babylonian Amora Rav Isaac bar Samuel Bar Martha. However, the Biblical justification of the prohibition is there given in the name of the early Tanna Rebbi Eleazar Ḥisma. Hence, the statement of the Yerushalmi is a genuine tannïtic one.: “Nobody should give messages with his eyes while reciting.” It was stated: “The hourly workers who worked for an employer have to recite the first benediction of Grace and subsume that of Jerusalem in the benediction for the Land and close with the benediction for the Land on 191). In order to reduce the expense for the employer (and, hence, increase employment for the poor), the hourly workers whose lunchbreak is paid for by their employer recite an abbreviated version of Grace that still contains all required elements. Since the Yerushalmi does not mention the benedictions before the meal it seems that the hourly workers are required to recite these [this is also the reading of the (5:24) and most of the manuscripts of the Babli, against the Venice text of the Babli (16a)].. But if they were working for him for their meals or if the employer was eating with them, then they recite all four benedictions.” Rebbi Mana said: This means that one may not work while reciting Grace. Otherwise, why do we have to say this? Let him work and recite the benedictions! Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac in the name of Rav Ḥuna: One should not stand and pray while he keeps a coin in his hand; (having the coin) in front of him is forbidden, at his back it is allowed. Rebbi Yasa used to bind them together and grab them in his hand. And for money matters, ( 14:25) “you shall bind the money together in your hand”, only in your hand. Rebbi Yose bar Abun thus taught his son-in-law Rebbi Hillel. Rebbi Ḥizqiah and Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa were sitting at one place and Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa had coins on him. There came the time for prayer, he unbound them and gave them to Rebbi Ḥizqiah. He bound them together little by little. They became untied and lost. He asked: What have you left? Rebbi Ḥanina that allowed praying if the carrier’s load did not exceed 4 . The statement is introduced here since it is explained on the authority of R. Jacob ben Aḥa who was the main person in the preceding section. The water referred to here is water used for the sprinkling with the ashes of the red heifer to cleanse from impurity caused by contact or closeness to the body of a dead Jew, as explained in 19 and the Mishnah tractate The ashes of the red heifer have to be given into מים חיים אל כלי, virgin fresh water in a vessel. This means that after being drawn from flowing water, the water has to be watched so that no kind of work is done with it. A lapse of attention to the water makes it unfit for use in cleansing from impurity. Nevertheless, Rebbi Ḥanina states that one may recite and even pray while carrying such water. This statement is obviously difficult to accept. Rav Ḥuna (the second) dismisses Rebbi Ḥanina’s statement as in obvious contradiction to generally accepted principles. said: Also one who has his water on his shoulder may recite and pray. Rav Ḥuna said: So the reciting of and praying do not require concentration? Rebbi Mana said: I pointed out the difficulty before Rebbi Phineas that even if you say that the recitation of does not need concentration, does prayer not need concentration, its reference to prayer must be a mistake even though it refers to a prior statement about prayer only. The sentence is a rhetorical question. In a text from the Cairo Genizah, it is formulated as a declarative sentence: “recitation of does not need concentration; prayer needs concentration”. The meaning is the same in both versions.? Rebbi Yose said: I confirmed it following what Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: You got it, the completion of the works of water nor pray while guarding it. that are not clear from the words of the Torah.",

I. Zimer, I. M. Peles, vol. 2, p. 47; there the editor gives several conjectural reasons in note 16. He also indicates that this is a possible reflection of old usages from the Land of Israel, never followed in Babylonia. It seems to me that the usage is quite understandable if it is noted that bride and bridegroom were in their low teens, the girl possibly even a pre-teen. The marriage was arranged by the parents, with minimal involvement of the parties to the wedding. Some time was needed for the parties to get acquainted enough to get intimate.. An action: Rabban Gamliël married and recited in the first night. His students said to him: Our teacher, did you not teach us that the bridegroom is free? He said to them: I will not listen to you to lift from me the Kingdom of Heaven even for one hour. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Eleazar ben Antigonos in the name of Rebbi Eleazar the son of Rebbi Yannai: This means that it is permitted to start sexual relations on the Sabbath Friday evening if he did not yet have intercourse with his wife, it follows that we expect him to be anxious about it also Friday night. If he were not allowed to have intercourse, then he could defer his anxiety for a day and recite . The problem is that he will make a wound in deflowering his wife and, in the normal case of a very young girl, the making of the wound is automatic. Now, the making of a wound is forbidden on the Sabbath but, according to Rebbi Simeon (bar Yoḥai), any work not done for its own sake is not forbidden, except in the case of an automatic consequence (פסיק רישא “cut off its head, will it not die?’). For the very young girls discussed here, the wound might be an automatic consequence. The entire discussion belongs more to X:1 where all the parallels in the Babli are found. The second part of the Yerushalmi is lost and it cannot be ascertained anymore whether the entire discussion of our Mishnah is taken from there.. Rebbi Ḥaggai said before Rebbi Yose: Explain it for a widow where he does not make a wound. He answered him: Did we not formulate “Four nights?: “About a young girl who marries before puberty, the House of Shammai say that one allows four nights and the House of Hillel say until the wound is healed” (one does not suspect any blood to be menstrual). While it is quite possible that a very young girl can already be a widow, the Mishnah cannot apply to her since the marriage festivities of a widow are only three days (Thursday, Friday, Sabbath) while those of a virgin are seven days ( 1:1). Hence, we cannot talk here about a widow.” Can you say four nights for a widow? Rebbi Jacob bar Savdi said: I asked the question before Rebbi Yose: What is the difference between her and him who breaks a clay amphora in order to eat a dried fig from it XXII:3: “One may break a clay amphora (whose top has been closed off by solid clay) in order to eat a dried fig from its contents, but he may not have the intent to make it into a permanent vessel,” i. e., he may not break the seal open in such a way that it needs no more action after the Sabbath to make the opening a permanent one that is easy to use. This follows the principle quoted before that according to R. Simeon, work not needed for its own sake is not forbidden on the Sabbath. Even R. Yehudah, who disagrees and states that any complete work is forbidden on Sabbath irrespective of intent, will agree that breaking off an irregular piece of the covering does not constitute complete work since it needs further regularization after the Sabbath. Rebbi Yose’s answer is that breaking the hymen is a complete action in itself and, therefore, both R. Simeon and R. Yehudah will forbid it: R. Simeon because of his intent and R. Yehudah because it is a complete action. In the Babli, the deflowered woman is called a vessel; the Yerushalmi only compares her to a vessel.? He said to me: But it says afterwards, “only he should have no intent to make it into a usable vessel.” And here when he has the intention of making her a married woman it is as if he had the intention of making her into a vessel. Rav Isaac bar Rav Meshirshia 6b), the same question is asked by Rebbi Ammi, the Galilean authority two generations earlier. said similarly: What is the difference between her and him who opens a boil on the Sabbath 107a) for the same reason as why the top of an amphora may be broken, with the same restriction as to intent.? He said to him, but it says afterwards: “only he should have no intention of making a permanent opening.” And here when he has the intention of making her a married woman it is as if he had the intention of making her into a vessel. It was stated is also quoted in Babli 5b, where it is determined that “others” means R. Simeon who states that an action not expressly intended is not forbidden on the Sabbath. It is explained there, that even though R. Simeon forbids actions which automatically imply some other action that desecrates the Sabbath, here he allows a first sex act on Sabbath since splitting the hymen is not a necessary consequence if the male partner is considerate (and, consequently, an intact hymen is no guarantee of virginity.) Since we decide on the Sabbath according to the opinion of Rebbi Simeon and since the medical statement is by Samuel, the greatest medical authority in the Babli, it is clear that the Babli decides that first sex relations on Friday night are permitted. (In the Middle Ages, poor people married on Friday afternoon in order to save expenses for a separate wedding meal.) It is seen here that the Yerushalmi is strictly of the opposite opinion; hence, the identity of “others” is not determined here.: “A man should not have first sexual relations on the Sabbath because he makes a wound; but others allow it.” Rebbi Yose bar Abun said: The reason of the others is that he is intent on his job; the wound results automatically. Assi said, it is forbidden. Benjamin from Ginzak 65a. According to the version which allows first sex acts on the Sabbath, Benjamin, called there “from Saqasan”, tried to follow a ruling attributed to Rav to the effect that a second sex act would be permitted even without waiting the seven days of a cleansing period regularly required of a menstruating women, and applied to the newlyweds since blood from the breaking of the hymen is indistinguishable from menstrual blood, as discussed in the following section. In the Babylonian version, Benjamin tried to act according to this ruling but he died before he could do so. went out and said in the name of Rab, it is allowed. Samuel heard it and resented it, he [Benjamin] died, he [Samuel] recited for him: praised be He Who smote him 25:39.. About Rav, he [Samuel] recited: ( 12:21) “The just will cause no wrong.” Samuel said: All the rules spelled out at the start of the last chapter of are theoretical and not for practical application 65a.. Rebbi Yannai fled even from married pre-puberty girls. They asked before Rebbi Yoḥanan: What about a second sex act? They said, he did not teach to take all for blood of the wound, how could he rule for a second sex act? What we are asking about is the case when there were days of interruption, days of purity, in between. Rebbi Abbahu said: I was the best man of Rebbi Simeon bar Abba and I asked Rebbi Eleazar: is it possible to have the second sex act? He permitted it, since he holds like Samuel, and Samuel said: One may enter a narrow gap 6b and is used there for the same argument as here. on the Sabbath, even if one rubs off some pebbles. Rebbi Ḥaggai said: I was the best man of Rebbi Samuel the Cappadocian; I asked Rebbi Josiah and he shrank from it. I asked Rebbi Samuel bar Isaac; he said: now, what is blood of a period and what is blood of virginity? It was stated in 1 (a collection in the Yerushalmi tradition.) At any meal during all seven days after the wedding, seven benedictions are said over a cup of wine for the newlyweds after grace is recited. The bride is required to drink from the cup of which her husband drank, as a fertility rite. Rebbi Eliezer notes that the groom is not allowed to take the cup back from the bride since she has to follow all the rules of the menstruating woman.: “The bride is forbidden for her house all seven days and he may not take from her the cup of blessings, the words of Rebbi Eliezer.” What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? It is impossible that not some menstrual blood be mixed in the blood of virginity.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He took a bath in the first night after his wife died. His students said to him: Did you, our teacher, not teach us that the mourner may not take a bath. He said to them: I am not like most other people, I am asthenic. HALAKHAH: Who ( 5, fol. 62d). There are some textual differences between the two texts, an occurrence rare in the Yerushalmi. But in fact the deviations of the text here from its original in are all scribal or printer’s errors, as is shown from the Rome ms. and the Genizah fragments. Therefore, the text here follows the text wherever there is manuscript evidence from to support that version. stated that the mourner is forbidden to take a bath during the entire seven days? Rebbi Nathan. Something happened to Rebbi Ammi, he asked Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba who instructed him “all seven days following Rebbi Nathan”. Something happened to Rebbi Yose; he sent Rebbi Abba bar Cohen to Rebbi Aḥa; he said to him: Rebbi, did you not so teach us that something happened to Rebbi Ammi, he asked Resh Laqish who instructed him “all seven days following Rebbi Nathan”. He said to him, maybe these were two separate incidents, we say it in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, you say it in the name of Resh Laqish. And also from the following: Something happened to Rebbi Ḥama, father of Rebbi Oshaya, he asked the rabbis and they forbade it. Rebbi Yose asked, which rabbis? The rabbis here or the rabbis in the South? If you say the rabbis of here, it is fine. If you would say the rabbis from the South, would he have asked minor authorities when greater ones were before him? If you say the rabbis of the South, some of them would allow and some of them would forbid, as we have stated: “At a place where it is customary to bathe after a funeral, one may bathe; in the South one bathes.” Rebbi Yose bar Abun said: He who permits that bath makes it like eating and drinking, ed. Chavel, p. 175–176), Rebbi Yose bar Abun restricts the bathing to the aftermath of the funeral and says that in the same way that the mourner must have his first meal prepared for him by his relatives and friends, so his relatives and friends must cleanse him after the funeral from dust and germs (שיבתא). Hence, where it is customary, e. g. in the South, the mourner can have one bath, prepared by others, just after the funeral but is forbidden to have another one for the rest of the period of mourning. It then is difficult to understand the question of Rabban Gamliel’s students. Ramban writes that either he lived in a community where that bath was not customary or he was not satisfied with the cold bath prepared for him but took a full warm bath with following rubbing with oil for his asthenic condition.. That means, about a bath for pleasure. But a bath that is not for pleasure is permitted. An example is the case of Samuel bar Abba who developed scab. They came and asked Rebbi Yose, what is the rule, may he bathe? He said to them: If he does not bathe, would he not die takes this as hyperbole since in case of danger to life everything is permitted except murder, incest, and idolatry; he does not consider the remark of Rebbi Yose a restriction on the use of any medically indicated bath.? If he needs it, even on the Ninth of Av. If he needs it, even on Yom Kippur 77b.. They saw Rebbi Yose, son of Rebbi Ḥanina, immersing himself. They did not know whether it was for his emission, they did not know whether it was to cool down because bathing in cold water is not called bathing 13a) declare that a cold bath is forbidden to a mourner (and, therefore, on the Ninth of Av) but is allowed on fast days (in a year of draught) when the emphasis is on deprivation.. Rebbi Abba taught like that which was stated (fol. 44d) or the first chapter of : “When somebody goes (on the Ninth of Av or Yom Kippur) to see his teacher and has to pass a river on the way, he crosses it without compunction.” The statement is given here to show that, in fact, taking a cold bath by walking through the ford of a river, is no infringement of the prohibition of taking a bath on these fast days.. Rebbi Aḥa taught about him who comes from the road and his feet ache that he is permitted to wash them with water. It has been stated: “A mourner and one banned on a trip are permitted to wear sandals. When they come to town they should remove them. The same holds for the Ninth of Av and public fasts.” It is stated: “In a place where one is used to greet mourners on the Sabbath one may do so. In the South one does greet.” The great Rebbi Oshaya went to some place, saw there mourners on the Sabbath and greeted them. He said to them: “I do not know the custom of your place, but be greeted according the custom of our place.” Rebbi Yose, son of Rebbi Ḥalaphta, praised Rebbi Meïr before the people of Sepphoris: A great, holy, and meek man. At some time, he saw mourners on the Sabbath and greeted them. They said to him 23a,b); according to that source the dispute was only settled in favor of the Southern stance in the days of Rebbi Yoḥanan.: Is that the one whose praise you proclaim? He said to them, what are his works? They said to him, he saw mourners on the Sabbath and greeted them. He said to them: you have to recognize his strength; he comes to make you aware that there is no mourning on the Sabbath. That is what is written ( 10:22): “The blessing of the Lord makes rich,” that is the blessing of Sabbath, “He will not add grief to it,” that is mourning, as it is said ( 19:3): “The king is grieving about his son.” is translated by “labor”, but the explanation here substitutes the more common meaning “grief”.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: And when his slave Tevi died, he received condolences about him. They said to him: Our teacher, did you not teach us that one does not accept condolences for slaves? He said to them: My slave Tevi was not like other slaves, he was honest. HALAKHAH: Hence, about unrelated freed men one accepts condolences? So is the Mishnah: one does not accept condolences for slaves. 16b: Since the slave is not related to his master, even if he were free the master would not accept formal condolences for him since these are restricted to those close relatives for which one has to keep a period of formal mourning. The answer is that the Mishnah has to declare explicitly that one does not accept formal condolences since the slave is a member of the household and, presumably, is treated like a family member, parallel to the case of a student for whom the teacher may accept condolences; see the section after the next. It happened that Rebbi Eliezer’s maidservant died 16b and, in the Yerushalmi version, in 1:9,10. and his students came to him for condolences but he did not accept. He entered the courtyard, they followed him there. He entered the house, they followed him there. He told them: I was thinking that you would be burned by lukewarm water but you are not burned even by boiling water. Did they not say that one does not accept condolences for slaves because slaves are in this like animals? If one does not accept condolences for unrelated free persons, so much more for slaves one does not accept condolences for slaves”, meaning that this is a rule that cannot be waved. In the Babli, his attitude is directly contradicted by Rebbi Yose, the most authoritative of the Tannaïm of the fourth generation. Rebbi Yose even recommends eulogies for honest slaves; this represents the Galilean attitude (not shared in Babylonia) and, while not spelled out in the Yerushalmi, is taken for granted in this passage which immediately after the present story gives examples of model eulogies for rabbis.. If one’s slave or animal died, people say to him: The Omnipresent may replace your loss. When Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada on 6:2, on 5:11., the nephew of Bar Qappara, died did Resh Laqish accept for him since he was his teacher and a student is beloved as a son 26b), only a student may formally mourn a teacher.. He went and eulogized him: ( 6:2) “My friend descended to his garden, to the spice patch, to shepherd in the gardens.” It would have been necessary only to say “ “My friend descended to shepherd in the gardens.” But “my friend” is the Holy One, praise to Him. “He descended to His garden”, that is the world. “To the spice patch”, that is Israel. “To shepherd in the gardens”, these are the peoples of the world. “And to collect lilies”, these are the just ones whom He removes from their midst. They gave a parable, to what can this be compared? To a king who had a son whom he loved very much. What did the king do? He planted a garden for him. When the son did the will of his father, the father searched in the entire world for a nice plant and planted it in his garden. When the son was making him angry, he cut down all his plants. So when Israel does the will of the Holy One, praise to Him, he searches the entire world and observes the just person, brings him and attaches him to Israel, like Jethro and Rahab. And when they are making him angry he removes the just ones from amongst them. A clarification. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba identified this R. Ḥiyya bar Abba as a Tanna of the fourth generation, contemporary of Rebbi Yose, Rebbi Jacob, and, therefore, Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai, since he appears there as a major partner in dialogues with the latter. and his group, some say Rebbi Yose bar Ḥalaphta and his group, and some say Rebbi Jacob and his group, were sitting to study Torah under a fig tree. The owner of the fig tree was coming every morning at sunrise and collected figs. They said, maybe he mistrusts us, let us change place. The next day, the owner of the fig tree came to them; he said to them: the one that you used to do with me you are withholding from me. They said to him: We thought that maybe you mistrust us. During the morning he came and informed them that if the sun shines on ripe figs they get wormy. At that time they said, the owner of the fig tree knows the best time to collect figs and he collects them. Likewise, the Holy One, praise to Him, knows the time of the just ones to be removed from the world and He removes them. When Rebbi Abun bar Rebbi Ḥiyya died, Rebbi Zeïra ascended his pulpit and eulogized him: ( 5:11) “Sweet is the year of the worker.” It does not say here “sleeps” but “whether he eats little or much.” To what can Rebbi Bun bar Ḥiyya be likened? To a king who hired many workers and there was one worker who was exceptionally productive in his work. What did the king do? He took him and walked with him the long and the short. In the evening, the workers came to receive their wages and he gave him his total wages with them. The workers complained and said: we were toiling the entire day and this one did toil only for two hours and he gave him his total wages with us! The king told them: This one produced in two hours more than what you produced all day long. So Rebbi Bun produced in Torah in 28 years what an outstanding student cannot learn in a hundred years. When Rebbi Simon bar Zevid died, Rebbi Illai ascended and eulogized him: Four things are used in the world and if they are lost, they have replacement, ( 28:1,2) “But silver has a source, and a place is where gold is refined; iron is taken from dust, and stone is smelted into copper.” Those, if they are lost, have replacement. But a scholar who died, who can bring us his replacement, who can bring us his substitute? ( 28:12,21) “Wisdom, where can it be found, where is the place of understanding? It is hidden from the eyes of all living!” Rebbi Levi3:8 (fol. 38b) also has Rebbi Levi. said: If the brothers of Joseph lost their spirit because they found something, as it is written ( 42:28) “they lost their spirit”, we, who lost Rebbi Simon bar Zevid, so much more! When Rebbi Levi bar Sisi); his collection became the foundation of study in Nahardea. died, the father of Samuel came and eulogized him: ( 12:13) “Final word: Everything has been heard, fear God.” To what can Rebbi Levi ben Sisi be compared? To a king who had a vineyard with a hundred vines which gave him every year a hundred barrels of wine. He reduced them to 50, to 40, to 30, to 20, to ten, to one, and this one gave him a hundred barrels of wine. This one vine was as dear to him as the entire vineyard. So Rebbi Levi bar Sisi was beloved before the Holy One, praise to Him, like all mankind. This is what is written () “Because that is all of man,” that one is like all of mankind 6b) this is a sermon of Rebbi Abba bar Kahana, a Babylonian who became preacher of the third generation of Amoraïm in Galilee.. Cahana117a,b; the interpretation is Rashi’s (117b). Rav Cahana was a young member of the Academy of Rav when Rav unsuccessfully tried to dissuade a Jew from informing against another Jew before the Persian authorities. Rav Cahana was so outraged that he slapped the would-be informer and broke his neck. Rav pointed out to him that under the new Sassanid regime the Jews had lost the criminal jurisdiction they had under the Parthians and that, therefore, he was liable to be prosecuted. Rav told him to go (“ascend”) to the Land of Israel, to the Academy of Rebbi Yoḥanan, but he warned him not to ask difficult questions from Rebbi Yoḥanan for seven years. This must have happened between the Sassanid victory in 226 C.E. and Rav’s death in 247 C.E. (Since the organization of the new Persian empire must have taken some time, the earliest time for Rav Cahana’s flight is probably around 235 C.E. When Rav Cahana returned to Babylonia, he became a student of Rav’s successors Rav Yehudah and Rav Huna; hence, he returned after 247 C.E.) In Tiberias, Cahana (whose rabbinical title is not recognized in the Yerushalmi) first kept Rav’s injunction but in the end he found a way to get around it and was recognized by Rebbi Yoḥanan as a great scholar. Unfortunately, by a birth defect or an accident, Cahana had unsymmetric lips which gave his face the look of a permanent smirk and Rebbi Yoḥanan got offended. He gave him an evil eye so that Cahana died. When informed that the smirk was no smirk but a bodily feature of Cahana, he went to the cave where Cahana was buried. The entrance to the cave was guarded by a poisonous snake which let Rebbi Yoḥanan enter only after he had publicly acknowledged that he had been a student of Cahana. Then he prayed in the cave and Cahana was resurrected from the dead. This is the basis of the questions asked here by the hoodlums. According to the Babli, Rav Cahana found the presence of R. Yoḥanan too dangerous. This will explain the roundabout way in which he asked for leave from the Academy in the Yerushalmi version. was very young when he came up here. A person in rags saw him and asked him, what is new in Heaven? He answered: The judgment over this man has been sealed. This happened to him and he was stricken. Another one in rags saw him and asked, what is new in Heaven? He answered: The judgment over this man has been sealed. This happened to him. He said: Did I not go up to gain merit, but I am sinning! Did I come up to kill the people of the Land of Israel? I shall go and step down the way I came up. He came to Rebbi Yoḥanan and said to him: A man whose mother wishes him well and whose step mother honors him, should he go there? He said to him, he should go there where he is honored. Cahana descended the way he came up. They came and told Rebbi Yoḥanan that Cahana had descended to Babylonia. He said, how could he go without asking permission? They told him: that question, that he asked of you, was his request for permission. Rebbi Zeïra went to have himself bled when he ascended here. He went and wanted to buy a pound, λίτρα) of twelve Roman ounces, slightly more than 12 avoirdupois ounces. It seems that Rebbi Zeïra incurred the wrath of the butcher by using the correct feminine form for the Greek , while common usage was which in Aramaic really should be masculine (but was not taken as such in popular use). of red meat from a butcher. He asked him: How much is that pound? He said to him, 50 minas and one slap. He said to him: Take 60, but he did not accept. Take 70, but he did not accept. Take 80, take 90, until he came to 100 and he did not accept. Then he said: Do what is your routine. The next morning he went to the Academy and said to them: Rabbis, what is this bad practice here that nobody can eat a pound of red meat unless they slap him! They said to him: Who is that? He said, the butcher so-and-so. They sent to him to bring him but they found that his coffin was being carried out. They said to him: Our teacher, all that? He said to them: That should happen to me, but I was not angry about him; did I not think that this was general practice? When Rebbi Yasa ascended here, he went to a barber. He wanted to bathe in a public bath of Tiberias. He met a scoffer who hit him once on his neck and said: The noose of this man is loose. There was an admistrator. sitting who was interrogating a robber. He went and stood there all laughing opposite him. The administrator asked him: Who was with you? He looked around and said: The one who is laughing here was with me. He fetched him, interrogated him, and he confessed about one murder. When they both went out, carrying two beams, Rebbi Yasa passed by going to the bath. He said to him: That noose which was loose you already tightened. He answered him: That is the bad luck of this man, is it not written ( 28:22): “Now do not scoff, that your fetters should not be tightened.” Rebbi Phineas, Rebbi Jeremiah, in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac: Scoffing is hard since its start is pain and its end destruction. Its start is pain since it is written “Now do not scoff, that your fetters should not be tightened,” and its end is destruction as it is written () “For destruction and finality I heard from the Lord of Hosts over the entire earth.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: The bridegroom may recite the in his first night if he wishes. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliël says, not everyone who wants to grab a reputation can do so. HALAKHAH: It was stated 1:7) refers to the Mishnah ( 1:4) that if there was no rain by the middle of the month of Ḥeshwan, distinguished people start fasting; public fasts because of the draught start only in Kislev. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel states that in matters that bring pain, everybody can join with the distinguished persons; only in matters that bring prestige, not everyone can join and a scholar cannot join if he has been duly appointed to a position of authority since in that case he has to avoid even the appearance of being better than the people under his authority. The Yerushalmi quotes this Tosephta anonymously, hence it accepts it as valid ruling.: In anything that gives pain, everyone who wants to distinguish himself may do so. A scholar does and may blessing come to him. In anything that gives praise, not everyone who wants to distinguish himself may do so. A scholar does except if he has been appointed to a position of public authority. It was stated: One may step to one side because of obstacles on the road 81b, Yerushalmi 5:1). If a road is impassable, one may walk on the shoulder even if the field is planted up to the roadbed.. And when one sinks, even into a field full of saffron. Rebbi Abbahu said 81b) concerning Rebbi, Rebbi Ḥiyya, and Rebbi Yehudah ben Qanosa. The disapproving conclusion, given here in the name of the late Amora R. Zeïra, an immigrant from Babylonia, in the Babli is attributed to Rebbi. This shows that the note of Rebbi Zeïra is a belated accomodation of Galilean practice to Babylonian standards.: It happened that Rabban Gamliel and Rebbi Joshua were on the road and stepped on the side because of obstacles on the road when they saw Rebbi Yehudah ben Pappos, who was sinking, coming towards them. Rabban Gamliël said to Rebbi Joshua: Who is this one who makes an exhibition of himself? He answered: This is Yehudah ben Pappos, all whose deeds are done for Heaven’s sake. He said to him, R. Astorre Parḥi gives the name as Pappos ben Yehudah, a man known for his extreme habits, cf. Tosephta 5:9. However, of the two men of this name mentioned in Talmudic literature, one is too early, in Temple times, and the other one is mentioned in the prehistory of the revolt of Bar Kokhba, too late).: Did we not formulate “In anything that gives praise, not everyone who wants to distinguish himself may do so. A scholar does except if he has been appointed to a position of public authority.” He answered him: Did we not also formulate, “In anything that gives pain, everyone who wants to distinguish himself may do so. A scholar does and may blessing come to him.” Rebbi Zeïra said, but only if he does not shame others. Clarification. Rebbi Miasha and Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac were sitting and eating in one of the upper synagogues. There came the time of prayer and Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac got up to pray. Rebbi Miasha said to him: Teacher, did you not teach us that once one started one does not interrupt 1:5. If the speaker is Rebbi Yasa, one would have to translate: “Did not Rebbi (the editor of the Mishnah) teach us …”.. And Ḥizkiah stated: Every one who is free from an obligation and does it anyway is called uneducated. He answered him: Did we not state but that he may do so if he wishes.: “The bridegroom is free?” The bridegroom, if he wants. He answered him: Is that not from Rabban Gamliël? He said to him, I can free myself as Rabban Gamliel did; Rabban Gamliel said: I shall not listen to you to lift from me the Kingdom of Heaven.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Anyone whose dead is lying before him is free from reciting and from . to Alfassi declares that good manuscripts do not contain the addition and it also seems that the addition was not accepted by Tosaphot. The carriers of the bier, their substitutes, and the substitutes of their substitutes, in front of the bier or behind the bier, those that are needed by the bier are free, those that are not needed by the bier are obligated. All of them are free from the obligation to pray. HALAKHAH: It was stated: “And from .”A from (3:5); a similar (with the names of Rebbis Eliezer and Joshua switched) is quoted in Babli 21a. All authorities in all sources agree that a mourner may not put on the entire first day of mourning, even if the burial was conducted in the preceding night. So there is no connection between and the necessity to attend to the burial. mourner may not put on on the first day; on the second day he puts on and when new faces appear during the seven days of mourning he takes them off; these are the words of Rebbi Eliezer. Rebbi Joshua says: On the first and second days he does not put on ; on the third day he puts on and if new faces come he does not take them off. If he does not put on even on the second day, why is it necessary to mention “anyone whose dead is lying before him”? Because he stated the one he stated the other(and from prayer, whether that is stated in the Mishnah or not), the mention of is added as a memory aid. Since for a long time the Mishnah was transmitted by memory, it could not have been written down. Memory aids are an important part of Mishnah composition.. Rebbi Zeïra, Rav Jeremiah in the name of Rav: Practice follows Rebbi Eliezer in putting on and Rebbi Joshua in taking off starting the second day after the funeral and does not take them off for a new visitor. In the Babli, this is a ruling of Ulla, one of the commuters between Babylonia and Galilee in the second generation of Amoraïm.. Rebbi Zeïra inquired: If he put them on on the second day, following Rebbi Eliezer, would Rebbi Eliezer act like Rebbi Joshua, not to take them off? Rebbi Yose bar Abun said: Is it so that Rebbi Eliezer would act like Rebbi Joshua, not to take them off? If it were so, we should say “practice follows Rebbi Eliezer.” for new visitors, then the ruling should have been: Practice follows Rebbi Eliezer on the second day and Rebbi Joshua from the third day on. Since days are not mentioned, it is clear that Rebbi Joshua’s opinion, that one does not take off for visits of condolence, does not depend on the day. In the Babli, this is the ruling of Rava, of the generation following Rebbi Zeïra. The Babli quotes from the early Tanna Rebbi Jehudah ben Tema that one puts on and takes them off even a hundred times. Since R. Jehudah ben Tema, whose time cannot be determined, precedes Rav in any case, his opinion is not of much practical value. Rebbi Abun said: It is written ( 16:3) “So that you should remember the day of your exodus from Egypt the totality of the days of your living;” the days when you are occupied with the living, not the days that you are occupied with the dead is one of them, are only for living and are invalid once one has to care for the dead. Rebbi Abun here follows the opponents of Ben Zoma in the first chapter who read כֹל֩, “the entirety” and not “all”. The verse gives a complete justification for the Mishnah, ., that the entire first day is not for , even after the burial.. It was stated: If he wants to be more stringent with himself is one of them, are only for living and are invalid once one has to care for the dead. Rebbi Abun here follows the opponents of Ben Zoma in the first chapter who read כֹל֩, “the entirety” and not “all”. The verse gives a complete justification for the Mishnah, ., that the entire first day is not for , even after the burial. one does not listen to him.. Why? Because of the honor of the deceased or because he has nobody to carry his load? What is the difference between them? If he has someone who is carrying his load; if you say because of the honor of the deceased it is forbidden, but if you say because he has nobody to carry his load, here he has somebody to carry his load. Has it not been stated: he is free from taking the on Tabernacles, nor may he blow the on New Year’s Day. While the rule of applies only to the intermediate days when burials are permitted, one never blows as an obligation except on a holiday.? Explain that it refers to weekdays. But has it not been stated: he is free from blowing the . Can you say on weekday? No, on holiday. Rebbi Ḥanina said after the end of the Sabbath. The Sabbath domain extends 2000 cubits from the last house of one’s city; one may not move outside that domain on the Sabbath.: Because he is obliged to bring him a casket and burial shrouds as we have stated ( 23:4): “One waits for nightfall at the borders of the Šabbat. domain to oversee matters for a bride and matters for a deceased to bring for him a casket, burial shrouds, fifes, and women mourners;” it is as if someone was carrying his load. When does one overturn the couches is found in IX. The entire discussion is taken from Yerushalmi 3:5; the is also found Babli 27a.? From the moment when the dead left the gate of the courtyard, the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But Rebbi Joshua says, from when the cover plate was laid on the grave.. And when Rabban Gamliel died, after he left the gate of the courtyard, Rebbi Eliezer said to his students: Overturn the couches. And when the cover plate was laid on the grave, Rebbi Joshua said: Overturn the couches. They said to him: We already did turn them over on the orders of the old man. Friday evening he rights his couch, at the end of Sabbat he overturns them. It was stated: “A 56a. Maimonides, in his commentary to , defines as a low couch (used for sitting only in the case of a mourner), much lower than a regular couch called . The Babli tentatively defines as a couch made of a frame onto which a leather mattress is attached by ropes. This definition may be compatible with the description given in the next section. is put upright is lifted to stand either on its front end or its foot end. But already (Rabbenu Asher ben Yeḥiël, 14th Century in Mayence and Toledo) has shown in his commentary to Babli that this explanation is impossible and that the statement must mean: it is left standing as is. The other commentators are influenced by the version of the Babli which instead of the passive form used here have an active “he stands them up”, which seems to imply an action by the mourner, not passive as is implied here. and is not turned over. Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar, the father of Rebbi and son of Rabban Gamliel. Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar was a Tanna of the last generation who lived to see the start of the second generation of Amoraïm. says, he removes its is קלמנטרין, the corresponding word in the Babli is קרביטין. The last word, according to Z. Frankel, is Greek τὸ κραβάτιον, Byzantine Greek κραββατάριον, “accessories to the bed”; this seems to be correct but is not very instructive. [Cf. also κράββατος “couch, mattress”; Latin , from Macedonian κράβατος “low couch, camp bed” (E. G.).] and that is enough XI reads: דרגש המקפת אינה נכפת. רבי שמעון בן אלעזר אומר מוריד קלמנטרין שלה וּמניחה כמות שהיא A surrounding is not turned over. Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar says, he removes the accessories and leaves it as is.” In this formulation, Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar explains that while the is not turned over, some sign of mourning has to be made. It seems that this is also the explanation here, that Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar adds a certain requirement to the first statement..” Rebbi Yosa in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: practice follows Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Yose, a couch whose posts are upright and removed together with it, he takes them off and that is enough. What is a couch and what is a ? Rebbi Jeremiah 20a/b, this appears in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan. said, one that one plaits on its body is a couch and one that one does not plait on its body is a . But have we not stated ( 16:1) “Bed and crib after he rubs them with fish skin.” If he plaits on its body, why does he rub? Rebbi Eleazar said, explain it with those Caesarean cribs that have holes. From where the overturning of beds? Rebbi Crispus in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: ( 2:13) “They sat with him towards the ground.” It does not say here “on the ground” but “they sat with him towards the ground,” on something close to the ground. It follows that they were sleeping on overturned couches. Bar Qappara said: A beautiful form I had in your house and you caused me to overturn 3:5 has לכופתה “to overturn it” (Babylonian Talmudic Hebrew.) The form לכופפה has no parallel in the Yerushalmi and might be a scribal error. Bar Qappara seems to think that persons die because of the sins of their relatives. This is appropriate only for children who cannot die for their own sins since nobody below the age of 20 is liable before the heavenly court. The following, alternate version also shows that Bar Qappara speaks about mourning for small children. it, you also overturn your bed! Some quote it by the expression “let him overturn; overturn 5:3. The agent is the bed on which one not only sleeps but also has sex. Hence, the couch is the agent which produces the birth of a new baby. the agent!” Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose, both in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. One said, why does he sleep on an overturned coach? So that he should wake up in the night and realize that he is a mourner. The other one said, since he sleeps on an overturned bed he wakes up in the night and realizes that he is a mourner. is found in almost identical form in Babli 17b, 23b, and the Yerushalmi source X. All the time that his deceased in lying before him, he eats at his neighbor’s, and if he has no neighbor, he eats in another room. If he has no other room, he makes a wall of separation and eats. If he is unable to make a wall of separation, he turns his face towards the wall and eats. He does not eat reclining; he does neither eat nor drink his fill. He eats neither meat nor drinks wine. One does not allow him to participate in a group to say Grace. If he recited Grace, one does not answer “amen” after him. If others recited Grace, he does not anwer “amen”. That is meant on weekdays. But on the Sabbath, he does eat reclining; he eats meat and drinks wine, eats and drinks his fill. One lets him participate in a group to say Grace. If he recited Grace, one does answer “amen” after him. If others recited Grace, he answers “amen”. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said: Because I allowed all of these, oblige him for all other obligations of the Torah. If I permitted him temporary life, so much more eternal life. Rebbi Judah ben Pazi in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Practice follows Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. If he was handed over to the public., he may eat meat and drink wine. If he was handed over to the carriers it is as if he was handed to the public. When Rebbi Yassa died, Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba received his mourners and gave them meat to eat and wine to drink. When Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba died, Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac received his mourners and gave them meat to eat and wine to drink. When Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac died, Rebbi Zeïra received his mourners and gave them lentils to eat, saying that this was the tradition16b as a Galilean tradition (transmitted by Rabba bar Mari, a student of Rebbi Joḥanan) that Jacob prepared a meal of lentils ( 25:29) for his father Isaac as the first meal after the burial of Abraham. The same tradition is given anonymously in the Galilean 63:16. The substitution of eggs used today instead of lentils is Babylonian ( 16b). Even though Rebbi Zeïra was Babylonian, the practice might have been that of the city of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac.. When Rebbi Zeïra was dying he commanded and said: “You should not accept mourning for me this day, tomorrow consolers.; ed. Chavel, p. 144) and those who quote from the latter. The only consistent interpretation is that of Levi Ginzberg: Rebbi Zeïra told his students not to be among the mourners the first day nor among those who arrange meals of consolation the next day. While he was a Babylonian by birth, he objected to the Babylonian practice that students mourn only one day for their teacher (Babli 25b) but wanted them to mourn for him the entire seven days (or not at all). מרזחיּא are those who arrange the meal for the mourners, מַרְזֵחַ; as Levi Ginzberg points out, this meaning in Galilean (not Babylonian) Aramaic is clear from on 1:2, towards the end.” Rebbi Isaac the son of Rebbi Ḥiyya the Scribe suffered an accident. Rebbis Mana and Yudan went to him. There was good wine, they drank a lot about the cups to be drunk in a house of mourning. (A cup of wine consists of two thirds water and one third wine). and laughed. The next day they wanted to visit him again. He said to them: Rabbis, is that what a man does to his friend? Yesterday, the only thing that was missing for us was that we would get up and dance! It is stated XIV. The Babli version, 8b, has 3 cups before the meal, 3 during the meal, and 4 after the meal for the four benedictions of Grace.: Ten cups one drinks in the house of a mourner: two before the meal, five during the meal, and three after the meal. These are the three after the meal: one for Grace, one for those who exercise charity, one for those who console mourners. And when Rabban (Simeon ben) Gamliel died, they added another three: One for the of the community was not only the reader but also the ritual slaughterer and general servant of the community.), one for the head of the community, and one for Rabban Gamliel. But when the Rabbinical authorities saw that they regularly got drunk they decreed and returned it to the original status. May a Cohen defile himself 21). The main place of these discussions is in Yerushalmi 7:1. for the honor of his teacher? The father-in-law of Rebbi Yannai the younger died. He was both his father-in-law and his teacher. He asked Rebbi Yose who forbade it. Rebbi Aḥa heard it and said: His students should defile themselves for him. The students of Rebbi Yose defiled themselves for him but ate meat and drank wine. Rebbi Mana told them: One of two things you cannot escape. If you are mourners, why did you eat meat and drink wine; if you are not mourners, why did you defile yourselves? May a Cohen defile himself for the honor of Torah? Rebbi Yose was sitting and teaching when a dead body was brought in. He did not say anything either to those who left or to those who remained sitting. Rebbi Nehemiah the son of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: My father did not walk under the arch of Caesarea 61a), following R. Simeon bar Yoḥai, that only Jewish graves defile “in a tent” but not Gentile ones. The problem is not mentioned in any of the surviving parts of the Yerushalmi; one might infer from the stories told here that the ruling of the Babli was not that accepted in Galilee. Nachmanides (ענין ההוצאה, תורת אדם ed. Chavel, vol. 2, p. קה) adds: “but R. Ammi (who also was a Cohen) did pass under them.” The rest of the paragraph supports the reading of Nachmanides.. Rebbi Ammi, Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Cohen and Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa went walking on those streets, Greek πλατεῖα (. ὁδός), “street”. of Sepphoris. They came to the arch and Rebbi Cohen left. They reached a place of purity and he returned to them. He asked them: “What were you discussing?” Rebbi Ḥizqiah said to Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa: “Do not tell him anything!” We do not know whether it was because he was angry that he left since one defiles oneself for words of Torah or whether it was because he 13a, for all defilements that have a Biblical basis.) was haughty of Nachmanides has גייסן. The Venice print has טייסן, “a flyer” which makes no sense. The implication seems to be that Rebbi Ḥizqiah, the Rabbinic authority, was piqued by the fact that Rebbi Cohen, a very minor figure, did not ask his opinion whether he might pass under the arc.. It is stated is in similar form in other Yerushalmi sources, 7:1, IV:25,26, Tosephta 1:12, 1:8, and in materially different Babylonian tradition in Babli 13a, 47a.: A Cohen may defile himself by leaving the Land 7:17. (The Babli takes the impurity of the “land of Gentiles” to be rabbinic, but this refers to the time when no ashes of a red heifer were available anymore and every Cohen was impure from the start, whereas the Yerushalmi might refer to earlier times, cf. Chapter 1, Note 3.) The prohibition for the Cohen to defile himself willingly derives from 21:1–15. for civil and criminal suits, for the consecration of the New Moon and intercalation of a year, to save a field from a Gentile, and he even may leave and lodge a complaint about it, to study Torah and to marry a wife. Rebbi Judah says, if he has a place to study, he should not defile himself. Rebbi Yose says, even if he has a place to study, he may defile himself, since a man may not have the luck to learn from every teacher. They said about Joseph the Cohen that he defiled himself and followed his teacher to Sidon. In truth, they said a priest should not go abroad unless one promised him a wife. May a Cohen defile himself for the lifting of hands 6:24–26) that the Cohen has to recite during morning prayers. Since the priest has to lift his hands for the blessing, in imitation of Aaron the High Priest ( 9:22), the entire ceremony is called “the lifting of hands”.? Gedilah, the brother of Rebbi Abba bar Cohen said before Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: A Cohen defiles defile himself to fulfill the obligation of reciting the priestly blessing. himself for the lifting of hands. Rebbi Aḥa heard it and said: I never told him anything. On second thoughts he said, maybe he heard from me that which Rebbi Jehudah ben Pazi said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: Every Cohen who stays in the synagogue and does not lift his hands transgresses a positive commandment, and he wanted to say that a positive commandment supersedes a negative commandment. I never told him anything. Bring him in and I will cause him to be flogged! Rebbi Abbahu was sitting teaching in the fortified synagogue in Caesarea; there was a coffin there. There came the time for lifting the hands and they did not ask him. There came the time for eating and they asked him. He said to them: For the lifting of hands you did not ask me, for eating you are asking me? When they heard this, each one was taking himself away and fled. Rebbi Yannai said: A Cohen defiles himself in order to see the king. When king Diocletian visited here, Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba was seen stepping over graves at Tyre in order to see him 19b), the ruling (and the statement of Rebbi Joḥanan) is not by an early Amora but by a very early Tanna, Rebbi Eleazar bar Ẓadoq, a Cohen who mentions having seen the late Herodian rulers before the destruction of the Temple. It was reported before that Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba was a Cohen. We also saw before that the Yerushalmi does not seem to exclude Gentile graves from the defilement of a “tent”; hence, it is not proven that Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba stepped over Jewish graves at Tyre. (The Babli, , notes that a Cohen is prohibited by Biblical commandment from stepping over a grave only if there is less than a hand-breadth of space between the corpse and the upper cover of the coffin, as explained in Mishnah VII; in most cases stepping over a grave is only a rabbinical prohibition which may be lifted in special circumstances.). Rebbi Ḥizqiah and Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: There is an obligation to see great persons of government, so that when the kingdom of the dynasty of David will return one will know how to distinguish one government from the other. When Rebbi Judah the Prince died, Rebbi Yannai proclaimed and said: “There is no priesthood today.” When Rebbi Judah the Prince, grandson of Rebbi Judah the Prince, died, Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba did push Rebbi Zeïra in the Gufna synagogue of Sepphoris and defiled him. When Nahoraï, the sister of Rebbi Judah the prince, died, Rebbi Ḥanina sent for Rebbi Mana but the latter did not come. He said to him, if one does not defile himself for them during their lifetime, so much less in their death. Rebbi Nassa.) said, in their death they made them like a corpse of obligation defile himself for a corpse of obligation. It is not too clear who is meant. We may assume that Maimonides writes from tradition when he formulates (, 3:10) ’’When a patriarch dies, everybody defiles himself for him, including Cohanim; they made him like a corpse of obligation for everybody because everybody is required to honor him and everybody is stunned by his death.” () note that the sentence “they made him like a corpse of obligation” is the statement of Rebbi Nassa. The discussion goes as follows: The sister of the patriarch Judah II died after him. Rebbi Ḥanina demanded that Rebbi Mana, a Cohen, should defile himself for her. Rebbi Mana retorted that, since he would not defile himself for her during the patriarch’s lifetime, when it would have constituted an honor for the patriarch, he might not do so after the patriarch’s death. Rebbi Nassa, in support of Rebbi Mana, explains that the defilement of Cohanim for the patriarch is because he is considered an obligation for all of Israel.. May a Cohen defile himself in honor of his father and mother? Rebbi Yasa heard that his mother had come to Bostra 31b) is much more explicit, stating that Rebbi Assi’s (Yasa’s) mother was mentally disturbed and that it turned out that her coffin arrived at Bostra.. He went and asked Rebbi Yoḥanan, may I leave? He said to him, if it is because of danger on the road, leave. If it is in order to honor father and mother, I do not know. Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, Rebbi Yoḥanan still needs to answer. He importuned him, so he said: If you decided to go, return in peace. Rebbi Eleazar heard this and said: there is no greater permission than that. May a Cohen defile himself in honor of the public? It is stated: When there are two acceptable roads, one long and pure, the other one short and impure: If the public was walking is from 4:14. Since the following 15 speaks about digging the grave, the text here speaks of the procession preceding the actual burial. A similar but different in the Babli ( 19b) deals with people returning after the burial. on the long one, he goes on the long one; otherwise, he goes on the short one in honor of the public. That refers to impurity by their words; also for impurity that is from the words of the Torah? From what Rebbi Zeïra said, so great is the honor of the public that it temporarily pushes aside a prohibition 9:2 that if somebody notices that his clothing is forbidden as , he may keep his clothes on until he gets home and does not have to stand naked or in his underwear in public., that means even impurity that is from the words of the Torah. Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Yose the Galilean, Rebbi Yasa bar Ḥanina: One does not ask rulings on practice before the bier of a deceased 3b) it is stated more generally, in the name of R. Joshua ben Levi, that words of Torah are forbidden in presence of a coffin. According to Rashi, the reason is ( 17:5): “He who scoffs at the poor blasphemes his Maker.” Since the dead person can no longer study Torah, he is poor in this respect.. But Rebbi Yoḥanan asked Rebbi Yannai before the bier of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoẓadaq about him who dedicated his holocaust sacrifice for the upkeep of the Temple, and he answered him 32a) states that a forbidden substitution is valid only from lesser to higher sanctity. The highest sanctity of a sacrifice is the עוֹלָה, the holocaust, which is totally burnt on the altar, whereas gifts for the upkeep of the Temple are only a monetary obligation. So it should be impossible to dedicate an for the upkeep of the Temple. However, a (Babli 32b) states that a holocaust which afterwards was dedicated for the upkeep of the Temple cannot be slaughtered unless redeemed first and the money given to the Temple. The answer given there (presumably by Rebbi Yannai) is that the obligation of redemption is purely rabbinical, a kind of fine, but that from the Torah the second dedication is invalid.! Let us say when he was far away or when they were bringing him to the study hall. But Rebbi Jeremiah asked Rebbi Zeïra before the bier of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac! Let us say that he answered him when he was far away; when he was close he did not answer him. It is stated: The carriers may not wear sandals on 358:3, this applies only to professional carriers, or members of a society that monopolizes the of carrying the bier, who will have to walk barefooted. However, it seems that shoes without laces would be permitted by the Yerushalmi. lest a shoelace of one of them break so he would be eliminated from the good deed. Rebbi Zeïra bent down during a eulogy. They wanted to straighten him up and found that he tarried. They said to him, what is this? He said to them, because we will go there, following ( 7:2): “Let the one who is alive take it to heart.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: When they buried the deceased and returned, if they are able to start and finish before they form the row would pass. The words “start” and “finish” refer to the recitation of . they should start, otherwise they should not start. Those who stand in the row, the innermost are exempt and the outer ones are obliged. HALAKHAH: 2:2 (fol. 20a). It is stated: “One does not take the dead for burial close to the recitation of the unless one does it one hour in advance or one hour afterwards, so that they may recite and pray.” But did we not formulate: “When they buried the deceased and returned” is correct?? Explain it for those who thought that they have a free period 19a), it is stated flatly that the restriction of the does not apply to funerals of important persons. In the opinion of the Babli, the situation envisaged by the Mishnah can apply to previously planned funerals. but they did not have a free period. It is stated 2:11. This Tosephta comes after the one dealing with the funeral (which will be quoted later in this Halakhah.) Hence, it clearly deals with a eulogy the funeral. The text of the Tosephta follows that of the Genizah fragments; it is slightly corrupted in the Venice (and Leyden) texts that have ההספד instead of the unusual המהספד (the corresponding word in the Babli would be המספיד.) [A seemingly similar in the Babli, 19a, deals with a eulogy before burial and has nothing in common with the text given here.]: The eulogizer and all who participate in a eulogy interrupt for the recitation of and do not interrupt for prayer. It happened that our teachers interrupted for the recitation of and prayer. Did we not formulate: “If they are able to start and finish”? Our Mishnah speaks of the first day, what is stated for the second day. Rebbi Samuel ben Eudaimon said: He who enters the synagogue and finds them standing and praying, if he knows that he could start and finish before the reader starts, so that he may answer “Amen”, he may pray, otherwise he should not pray. About which “Amen” did they talk? Two Amoraïm, one says the Amen of “the holy King” was recited only on special days; it probably was not recited in the Sabbath afternoon prayers and, hence, it is not mentioned that one should be able to respond to . and the other says the Amen of “He Who listens to prayer”. Rebbi Phineas said, they do not disagree. He who said: the Amen of “the holy King”, on the Sabbath, and he who said: the Amen of “He Who listens to prayer” on weekdays. It is stated ( 2:11): “Rebbi Judah says, if they all are standing in one row, those who are standing because of honor are obliged, those because of mourning are exempt 19b), Rashi reads: “those who come because of themselves”, not “because of honor”, but most manuscripts and old authors have “because of honor”. Also, in the Babli only the second part of the Tosephta is attributed to Rebbi Yehudah. According to Rashi, only those are obliged to read the who come out of curiosity whereas according to most others those who come to honor the dead and his family but do not actively console are not exempt. The Babylonian Talmud makes no comment; we have to assume that it accepts the position of R. Samuel Tosephta.. When they descend for a eulogy, those who see inside are exempt, those who do not see inside are obliged for themselves without offending anybody..” It would be that what we stated: “Those who stand in the row, the innermost are exempt and the outer ones are obliged” is the last teaching, and what is stated: “Those who are standing because of honor are obliged, those because of mourning are exempt”, is the first teaching. And what we have stated there (Mishnah 2:2): “When he19a, where it is noted that also under that system people quarrelled in Jerusalem. Here the copyist (or the editor) seems to have doubts whether to go with the definition of “first” and “last” as above or to call “first” the first practice reported by Rebbi Ḥanina and “last” the second one. Hence, there are two opinions about the attribution but the meaning is clear. If the uncertainty is the editor’s, then the note “Another opinion: the first” belongs to the text. If it is the scribe’s or some reader’s, then it is a gloss that has entered the text from the margin. For consistency, the hypothesis of a gloss is preferable. consoles others, all the people stand one behind the other and the executive officer becomes a partition between himself and the people”, the last teaching. (Another opinion: the first.) Rebbi Ḥanina said: Originally, all families were standing still and the mourners passed between them. When competition increased in Sepphoris, Rebbi Yose ben Ḥalaphta decreed that the families should pass by and the mourners stand still. Rebbi Samuel Tosephta 2:2 (fol. 20a) “Rebbi Samuel of Sofephta”. Tosephta might be the region of Northern Armenia, called Thospitis by Ptolemy, which was the birthplace of Rabba Tosphaä, one of the later heads of the Academy of Sura in Babylonia. said: Matters returned to their original state.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Women, slaves, and minors are exempt from reciting the and from phylacteries but are obliged for prayer, , are based on verses in , their status is different. and Grace for food. HALAKHAH: Women from where? ( 11:19) “You must teach them to your sons.” To your sons but not to your daughters, the same is valid for reciting the . It is general practice that women recite ; it follows that in the opinion of the Yerushalmi, women may study any subjects of Torah they wish. [The Babli, 20b, simply notes that is an obligation to be executed at stated times, of which women and slaves are automatically exempted. Since the Yerushalmi brings this argument in relation to other things later in this section, it follows that for it the recital of is simply an aspect of Torah study and Torah study is required “day and night”, not depending on any particular time.]. Slaves from where? ( 6:4): “Hear, o Israel, the Eternal, our Power, the Eternal is unique.” He who has only one Lord, this excludes the slave who has another lord as an obligation to be performed at stated times; therefore, a separate argument is necessary to free from the obligation slaves who accepted Judaism.. Minors from where? ( 13:9) “So that the Torah of the Eternal should stay in your mouth”, at a time when he is permanent in it. 2) The verse deals only with . In the Yerushalmi tradition, the statement and the tradition are not unquestioned. Both (, ed. Horovitz-Rabin, p. 68; , p.41), the Tannaïtic commentaries to Exodus, give the same commentary on the next verse ( 13:10): “You must preserve this decree in its time, from year to year”. “Why has this been said? Because it has been said (v.9): ‘It shall be for you a sign on your hand’, I might understand this to include minors. And it is logical, since is a positive commandment and are a positive commandment; if you find that applies to minors the same way it applies to adults you might think that apply to minors the same way they apply to adults, but the verse says ‘you must preserve this decree’, I spoke only about those able to watch over their ; from here they said: If a minor knows how to watch his , his father makes him .” The argument presupposes the statement that minors are obliged to have on their doors (meaning that if they live alone, the rabbinic authorities have to see to it that they have on their doors). and are always mentioned together in the first two paragraphs of . Hence, one may assume that they are identical in those details that are not spelled out. Both Yerushalmi and Mekhiltot agree that some explanation is needed to distinguish between the rules for and those for . However, the Mekhiltot extend the obligation of to all school children whereas the Yerushalmi restricts it to those for whom the study of Torah is a permanent obligation, i. e., from Bar-Miẓwah onwards. In itself the argument about minors is totally irrelevant; it is needed to exclude the opinion of the Mekhiltot.. They are obliged to pray so that everybody ask mercy for himself 20b), the argument of the Yerushalmi is repeated but then it is stated that in Psalms ( 55:18) three times daily are stated for prayer and if that were a general obligation, women would be automatically dispensed from it. Hence, it follows that the rabbinical obligation of prayer for women cannot mean for the Babli an obligation to pray at those stated times, which it could mean in the interpretation of the Yerushalmi. The opinion of the Babli is that of Maimonides, the possible one of the Yerushalmi that of Nachmanides.. And for , as it is written ( 6:9): “You shall write them on the doorpost of your house and your gates. And grace after meals, as it is written ( 8:10): “You will eat and be satiated; then you must praise the Eternal, your God.), this remains questionable.” There (Mishnah 1:7) we have stated: “Every positive commandment that is activated by time, men are obliged by it but women are exempt. Every positive commandment that is not activated by time, both men and women are obliged by it.” (Tosephta 1:10): “What is a positive commandment that is activated by time? For example , , , and . What is a positive commandment that is not activated by time? For example lost articles 22:1–3., sending away the nest 22:6–7., railing 22:8., and in the third section of where it is stated that they must be seen, so garments, worn exclusively in the night when it is dark, do not need . The Babli ( 33b–34a; 43a) mentions neither nor the opinion of Rebbi Simeon in its quotes from the Tosephta; it assumes the position of Rebbi Simeon to be generally accepted.. Rebbi Simeon exempts women from because it is a positive commandment activated by time.” Because a nightgown is exempt from . Rebbi Lia said: The reason of the rebbbis is that, if a garment is designated both for daytime and for night, it needs . It is stated: “For every obligation that a man is free of, he may help the congregation to fulfill their obligation, except for Grace.” But have we not stated: “Anybody who is not obligated may not help the congregation to fulfill their obligation”? If he were obligated, he could help them to fulfill even if he himself already fulfilled it! on Rosh Hashanah nevertheless may blow the and recite the appropriate benediction for somebody who did not hear the blowing. The only exception mentioned is that of saying Grace. The second statement means, e. g., that a woman, not being obligated to hear the , may not blow the for a man who is obligated. Since everybody is obligated to say Grace after a meal, there seems to be no reason why Grace should be exempted in the first statement. Rebbi Lia said: There is a difference about Grace since it is written ( 8:10): “You will eat and be satiated, then you must praise the Eternal, your God;” he who ate must give praise. Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Judah ben Pazi were sitting together and saying: It would be reasonable and prayer. The argument for rests on the expression ( 6:7) ושננתם ל֩בניך “you should repeat it to your sons”; it implies a personal action and cannot be performed by listening to a reader. The discussion of prayer presupposes the Galilean practice that the reader recite the aloud, without silent prayer, and it is stated that everyone is required to say the prayer with the reader, not just to respond with “Amen”. In Babylonia the question did not arise since silent prayer was always required before the repetition by the reader. for reciting the that every single person should repeat it aloud. It would be reasonable for prayer that every single person should pray for mercy by himself. What and were mentioned as examples of temporary obligations and 2) it was the subject of a discussion between Rebbi Yose (the Amora) and one of his colleagues. is the difference between and does not need a benediction after the first night of the holiday, needs a benediction all seven days 6:9,10) discussed more in detail later (Halakhah 9:4, fol. 14a) and in Babli 46a, where Rebbi states that one makes a benediction all seven days of Sukkoth and that Babylonian practice follows Rebbi. Galilean practice followed the rule that the benediction “Who commanded us to dwell in the ” was recited only once during the entire holiday. About , the Babli notes correctly that in the absence of a Temple, taking the after the first day is a rabbinic ordinance, not a Torah commandment; hence, the obligation of the second day cannot be covered by the benediction of the first. It may be that this distinction caused Rebbi Yose to be dissatisfied with the first explanation.. Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Aḥa were sitting and saying, what is the difference between and applies both nights and days, applies only during daytime is one continuous obligation, represents seven distinct periods of obligation of which each one merits a new benediction.. Rebbi Jacob the Southerner objected: But the study of Torah applies by night as by day? How is this? will end; the study of Torah, it is impossible that it should ever end at least gets a new benediction every year.. It is stated 5:17, Babli 20b, 38a. The entire piece is found in 3:11, 3:9.: In truth, they said a woman may say Grace for her husband, a slave for his master, and a minor for his father. Did not Rebbi Aḥa say in the name of Rebbi Yose bar Nahoraï: All they said about a minor is for the latter’s education? Explain it that he recites after him, as we stated there: “He for whom a slave, a woman, or a minor were reading it, repeats after them what they are saying, and may it be a curse for him. In truth, they said there should be a curse on the man of twenty years who needs the child of ten.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who had thinks but does not recite any benediction before or after.; on his food he recites the benedictions afterwards but not before. Rebbi Yehudah says, he recites benedictions before and after. HALAKHAH: What does he think of? The benedictions, which is an obligation from the Torah, he recites normally. But Rashi explains “he thinks the ‘ ”, and this also seems to be the opinion of Maimonides in his decision based on the Babli.. The Mishnah deals with a place where there is no water that even Rebbi Yehudah agrees that after an emission one may not recite unless he washed first. So this statement is agreed to by everybody in the Yerushalmi. and follows Rebbi Meïr, as it is stated (Tosephta 2:13): “He who had but no water to immerse himself reads the but not so that he himself can hear it, but he does not recite any benediction before or after; these are the words of Rebbi Meïr. But the Sages say, he reads so that he himself can hear it and recites benedictions before and after. 22a) quotes a parallel but different in which the position of “the Sages” is in the name of R. Yehudah.” It is stated (Tosephta 2:12): “A sick person who had on whom fell nine equals 4 , one log is .533 liter or .164 gallons, so that a equals approximately .563 gallons, 9 about 5.07 U. S. gallons. One is 6 or about 3.38 gallons, so 40 equal about 135.2 gallons or 512 liter. In Roman measures, the corresponds to the , and the to the . That makes 40 equal to a Roman . of water (and a pure one on whose head and body fell three of drawn water) 15:16) but the prohibition of studying Torah and speaking sacred words is from the institutions of Ezra, i. e., it is pre-rabbinic. On the other hand, the impurity of a person washing himself with drawn water after an immersion in a belongs to the “18 ordinances” passed by the adherents of the house of Shammai before the Jewish revolt against the Romans and is purely rabbinical. It was passed because most were not built but were water holes in natural caves that were naturally muddy and people had the tendency to wash off the mud after they emerged from the . The rabbis of the time were afraid that in time washing would supersede immersion as (illegal) means of purification, so they decreed that washing after immersion resurrects some mild form of ritual impurity. is clean for himself but he cannot lead the public in their obligations until he immersed himself in 40 . Rebbi Yehudah says, 40 in all cases. .) takes the statement of Rebbi Yehudah to mean that he requires the stated amount of water but not that it should be in a that satisfies all rules. However, as Levi Ginzberg points out, that requires the expression בכל מקום which is found in manuscripts of the Babli; it represents the majority opinion in the Babli. The idiomatic translation of מכל מקום is “in every case”, including the sick person. R. Yehudah then is more restrictive than the other sages if water is available, and this may be the meaning of the Yerushalmi. If the parenthesis is genuinely part of this , then the latter interpretation is the only possible one since an impurity imposed to enforce immersion in a genuine can be removed only by such an immersion..” Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: is only from sexual intercourse. Rav Huna said, even if he saw himself enjoying in his dream. They wanted to say, only from a woman. Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose, both of them say, even from something else. There (Mishnah 8:1) we have stated: Eating, drinking, washing, anointing, wearing shoes, and sexual intercourse are forbidden on . And it was stated in that respect: Men with immerse themselves secretly in their normal way on 4:5 and Babli 88a the reading is: Men with immerse themselves normally on one speaks of a full immersion and “in secret” is not mentioned. The Tosephta seems to be a Babylonian formulation. (The entire paragraph is also found in Yerushalmi 8:1).. Does this not contradict Rebbi Joshua ben Levi since Rebbi Joshua ben Levi says, is only from sexual intercourse? Explain it if he had intercourse on the previous day and forgot and did not immerse himself. But it is stated: It happened that Rebbi Yose ben Ḥalaphta was seen immersing himself secretly on . Can you say about that holy body that he forgot? Rebbi Jacob bar Abun said: This immersion has only been enacted so that Jews should not be like chickens, that one would have sex: mount, descend, and eat 22a, in the name of R. Yose bar Abun) reads: “so that scholars should not be found near their wives like roosters.” One may conclude that there are two main differences between Galilean and Babylonian practice: In the Yerushalmi, the duty of immersion applies uniformly to everybody and requires a kosher , in the Babli it is necessary only for study and may be done by washing. R. Jacob bar Abun was a Galilean Amora of the third generation, colleague of R. Jeremiah. There is no hint anywhere that one is forbidden to eat after intercourse or before immersion; the expression here is just a graphic expression of the behavior of cocks (commentary of Levi Ginzberg).. Rebbi Ḥanina passed by the gates of public baths only hinders one to pronounce the Divine name (and, hence, to pray) but not to study where the Divine name is seldom mentioned and, if mentioned at all, only by paraphrase. On the other hand, when morning came and the time for morning prayers, he told those that had intercourse to go and immerse themselves before praying. before dawn and said: What are those who have to immerse themselves in the morning doing here? They should go and study Mishnah! In the morning he said: He who has to do it shall go and do it. What are the rules about thinking in the study of Torah subjects. in the toilet? Ḥizqiah said it is permitted; Rebbi Yasa said it is forbidden. Rebbi Zeïra said, all difficult arguments that I had became clear to me there. Rebbi Eleazar bar Simeon 102b. In Babylonia (Babli 24b) it was accepted by everybody that thinking about Torah subjects in a toilet is forbidden except if the person cannot help doing it. In Galilee the practical rule was to allow it. said, the entire difficult subject of became clear to me there. Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Tanḥum ben Rebbi Ḥiyya: In the days of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi they wanted to abolish this immersion because of the Galilean women who became sterile were cold-water ; in a parallel in Babli 22a, Rav Huna notes that instead of a one could use a hot bath in Babylonia. because of the cold. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi told them: Do you want to uproot something that fences Israel off from sin? What means: Fences Israel off from sin? It happened that a watchman of vinyards wanted to have an affair with a married woman. By the time they were preparing a place where they could immerse themselves, passers-by came by and the sin was not committed 22a is explicitly designated as a , dating from Mishnaic times, and applying the need for immersion only to the man. [Levi Ginzberg conjectures that the watchman was a bachelor; hence, he could not use the public (except on holiday eve) without drawing public attention to his unmarried sexual activities. However, it is stated explicitly at the end of this that a was not used for this immersion.]. It happened that someone wanted to have an affair with Rebbi’s slave girl. She said to him: If my mistress does not immerse herself, I do not immerse myself and, therefore, cannot have sex with any man. The slave girl was quite famous for speaking better classical Hebrew than the rabbis.. He said to her: Are you not like an animal? She said to him: Did you not hear that one who has relations with an animal will be stoned, as it is said (Ex. 22:18): “Anyone lying with an animal shall certainly be executed.” Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: They ordered this immersion essentially only for study. For if you tell him that he is permitted, he is going to say: “I shall go, satisfy my needs, and then come and study what is needed,” but since you say that it is forbidden, he will come and study all he needs. There they said it is even forbidden to hear words of Torah. Rebbi Judah bar Titus, Rebbi Aḥa in the name Rebbi Eliezer: as at the start ( 19:11) “They shall be prepared on the third day, do not approach a woman for the study of Torah is derived from the theophany at Sinai where the Israelites purified themselves for three days from any impurity caused by marital relations. This gives support to the opinion stated earlier by R. Joshua ben Levi that the impurity of is only caused by sexual intercourse. The Talmud notes (Babli 86a, Yerushalmi 9:3, fol. 11c) that a separation of three days was needed only for the women since a woman may lose live sperm from her body up to three days after intercourse. For men a simple immersion in water the next day would be enough. This proves that women were included by Divine decree among the original recipients and students of the Torah; the inclusion of women in the Tosephta quoted in the next paragraph is intentional..” It is stated 2:12. In the parallel in the Babli, 22a, only males are in the list. The in the Babli is a Babylonian formulation of material ascribed to the students of Rebbi Aqiba.: “Males and females with discharges suffering from gonorrhea and similar diseases, the female bleeding other than menstruating, see Chapter 15., menstruating women, and women having given birth 12:1–8. read in the Torah and study to the last four books of the Pentateuch., practical rules, and homiletics; the person with is forbidden all these.” Rebbi Abba bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi 2:24); since a slave is not legally able to contract a marriage, he is missing the essential human quality of having to marry. That makes questionable humans out of adults who are bachelors by choice. [The sex life of slaves is not discussed in the Yerushalmi. In the Babli ( 47a) it is stated that slaves may have sex with anybody except a Jew (and a married Gentile woman).]: He may study practical rules but not homiletics. It is stated in the name of Rebbi Yose: He may repeat known rules but he may not expound the Mishnah. Some want to say, only that he may not mention the Divine Name. Rebbi Zeïra asked before Rebbi Yasa: Did my teacher not prepare his lecture together with Rebbi Abun in the night? He said, yes. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba prepared his lecture together with his son Rebbi Neḥemiah in the night. The next morning he said, anybody who has to do should go and do it is the same as one who is at a place with no water. While the sources do not discuss the position of Torah study at a place without water, it seems from here and the story about Rebbi Yose in the paragraph following the next that in the night one never goes for the immersion required and that, therefore, all involved here may study Torah during the night and immerse themselves in the morning before prayers.. It happened that someone was reading the Torah in Nsebin 22a), the reason is given that God’s word is compared to fire and fire cannot become impure.; when he came to the Divine Name he started to stutter. Rebbi Yehudah ben Bathyra told him: Open your mouth and let your words shine because words of the .Torah cannot receive impurity. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said: There they act following Rebbi Illaï regarding the first shearing 18:4. While it is not spelled out in the Pentateuch that this is an obligation only on sheep owners in Israel, “there” in Babylonia one did not give first shearings to the Cohen. The entire statement is quoted in the Babli ( 22a) in the formulation “people follow these three”, in the name of Rav Naḥman bar Isaac, a Babylonian contemporary of R. Jacob bar Aḥa., following Rebbi Josiah regarding in a vineyard are based on 22:9: “Do not sow your vineyard ”. Usually, a vineyard is not sown but planted; R. Josiah therefore restricts the prohibition to the case where even the vines are grown from seeds sown, not planted one by one in separate places. in the vineyard, and following Rebbi Yehudah ben Bathyra regarding people with . Following Rebbi Illaï regarding the first shearing. as we have stated: “Rebbi Illaï said: The first shearing applies only in the Land.” Following Rebbi Josiah regarding as it is stated: “One is never guilty unless one sowed wheat, barley, and grape kernels falling from the same hand.” Following Rebbi Yehudah ben Bathyra regarding people with as it is stated: “Rebbi Yehudah ben Bathyra says, words of the Torah cannot receive impurity.” Rebbi Yose bar Ḥalaphta came on a footpath (the Rome ms. has איסרטא, “a paved [street].”) This story belongs to the discussion of the paragraph before the last and shows that in the minds of the people the original intention of the ordinance requiring washing was inverted, that instead of “fencing off Israel from sin” it became a ritual in the minds of the uneducated with which one could wash off even adultery with a menstruating women, combining a capital crime with one punishable by extirpation. Hence, the story supports Rebbi Yehudah ben Bathyra who negates the importance of the ritual even for public reading of the Torah, not only for Torah study. in the night and a donkey driver was walking after him along a ditch. He said to him: This man must wash. He said to him: Do not imperil yourself. He said to him: This man must wash because of a menstruating, married woman. Even so he said to him: Do not imperil yourself. Since he did not listen to him he said: May this man descend and not ascend. And that happened to him. Rebbi Yose ben Yose, Saur, München 1996, p. xviii). came on a ship. He saw one who was tying a rope around himself in order to descend and wash. He said to him: Do not endanger your life. He said to him: This one needs to eat. He said to him: eat! This man needs to drink. He said to him: drink! When they came to the harbor, he said to him: There I permitted it only because of danger to your life but here this man may not taste anything before he washes. Rebbi Yannai for the immersion of ; either one uses a regular bath or a running stream or the sea (whose total volume is certainly greater than 40 .) The parallel in the Babli ( 22a) has only the first part of the statement and no hint of using running water. Running water is required for the cleansing of the male with gonorrhea ( 15:13). said: I heard that some take it lightly and some are stringent and every one who is stringent lives a long, good life. Some take it lightly by washing in drawn water; some are stringent to immerse themselves in running water.",

If he descended to immerse himself, if he can ascend, get dressed, and recite The leniency mentioned here is not only if otherwise the time for would pass but even for the usage of the very religious (Chapter 1, Note 155) even though it is totally impossible to pray the while immersed in the water and, therefore, one cannot completely follow the practice of the very religious. by the time of sunrise he should ascend, get dressed, and recite; otherwise, he should cover himself with water and recite. He should cover himself neither with stinking water nor with steeping water unless he diluted them with water. How much does one have to remove oneself from these and excrement? Four cubits. HALAKHAH: The Mishnah refers to someone in public, but if he is alone he interrupts following Rebbi Meïr is composed of benedictions, it is clear that Mishnah 4 forbids formal praying. Both Mishnah 4 and Mishnah 5 are anonymous; an anonymous Mishnah is always supposed to represent the ideas of Rebbi Meïr since the latter’s collection was the basis of Rebbi’s edition of the Mishnah. To avoid two contradicting Mishnayot, it is spelled out here that the public embarrassment that would be caused by the rule of Mishnah 4 has to be avoided, see 1, note 119. The opinion of R. Yehudah is given in Mishnah 4.. But following Rebbi Yehudah he does not interrupt even when alone, on condition that he have no water to immerse himself. But if he has water to immerse himself even Rebbi Yehudah agrees that he must interrupt. About a sick person who had intercourse, Rebbi Ammi said: If he caused it by himself, let him immerse himself and die; if it was forced upon him one does not bother him comes only from intercourse or also from involuntary emissions. If the second case is accepted, “forced” does not speak of intercourse but only of involuntary emissions. In the second case, one cannot say that one speaks of a sick man fulfilling his marital duties even if it hurts him since in that case he is free from these duties. Even if he was seduced by his wife, there is really no intercourse against one’s will. Hence, one has to conclude that all authorities here decide that involuntary emissions require immersion in water.. Rebbi Ḥaggai in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Zavda: One does not bother him in any case. A sick person 22b), Rava reports that any מרגיל needs 40 . Since the immersion was not practiced in Babylonia, this statement is purely historical or theoretical; the difference between Babylonia and Israel was in the essence of this immersion and not in little details. who does it habitually upon himself by having intercourse.” A strictly grammatical explanation would be: “he causes it to be usual”. However, such a translation would require three categories: 1) one who runs after sex, 2) a normal person, 3) a sick person. Since only two categories are mentioned where one would expect three, Rashi’s explanation is the only consistent one even if it does not explain the particular verb form. needs nine , a healthy person who does it habitually needs 40 . A sick person forced, one does not bother him. A healthy person forced needs nine . Rebbi Zevadiah, the son of Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi, in the name of Rebbi Jonah: In a city whose well is far away, he may recite the , then descends and immerses himself, ascends and prays. If he is blind, but this makes no sense here. In other Talmudic passages “an outstanding man” means a particularly pious one and it is unimaginable that a pious man should claim for himself exemption from some religious duty. Hence, the derivation from the root “to blind”, in the passive “to be blinded”, makes much more sense. they made him like a far-away well. New Section. “Otherwise, he should cover himself with water and recite.” The Mishnah deals with opaque water, but in clear water it is forbidden 25b).. And if he is able to make it opaque by stirring with his feet he may make it opaque. It is stated: One removes himself. from human excrement four cubits and from dog’s excrement four cubits, the latter when it is given on skins explains that “steeping water” in the Mishnah refers to tanner’s steeping water and not to launderer’s steeping water that simply does not smell good. This statement is from Tosephta 2:16; the Babli (25a) has a different that refers to the paragraph after the next one here.. Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: One must remove hinself four cubits from a stinking carcass. Rebbi Avina said: Does not the Mishnah say all this : “How much does one have to remove himself from these and excrement? Four cubits.” Rebbi Ammi in the name of Rebbi Shammai, Chap. 3, #44) in the name of Rebbi Simlaï (without mention of Rebbi Ammi), a preacher and Amora of the first generation.: Explain it by steeping water of launderers. Rebbi Mani said to him: About steeping waters of launderers, we have stated: “neither with stinking water nor with steeping water.” It is stated: One removes himself four cubits from excrement and urine of a toddler who can eat grain the volume of an olive 42b) is defined as the time a grown-up can eat half a stuffed pitta. The Yerushalmi does not give a time limit., but if he cannot yet eat grain the volume of an olive one does not need to remove himself four cubits either from his excrement or from his urine. They asked before Rebbi Abbahu: Why does one separate himself from his excrement and urine? He said to them, because his thoughts are evil. They said to him: But is not he too young? He said to them, is it not written ( 8:21): “For the inclination of man’s heart is evil from his youth?” Rebbi Yudan said, it is written “from his awakening, is written defective in the Bible; hence, it can be vocalized נִעֲרָיו “his awakenings”, not only puberty, the sexual awakening usually referred to by the root נער but also the first awakening of the baby during birth. According to Rebbi Abbahu, the awakening comes only when the baby is weaned.”, from the moment that the awakes and enters the world. Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina said: One removes himself four cubits from animal dung. Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, if it is soft, but only from donkeys. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, if it arrived from a trip. Levi said, one removes himself four cubits from the excrement of a pig. And it was stated: One removes himself four cubits from the excrement of a pig, four cubits from the excrement of a marten, four cubits from the excrement of chickens. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rav Huna: Only from red 14b as a separate kind. All these are singled out for their obnoxious smell. ones. It is stated: One removes himself four cubits from a bad smell. Rebbi Ammi said, four cubits from the end of the bad smell. That means behind his back, but in front of him until he can no longer see it. Like that of Rebbi Lia and his colleagues who were sitting in front of a hostelry in the night. They said, may one say words of Torah? He said to them: If it were daytime, we would see what is before us. But like that it is forbidden. It is stated: One must remove himself four cubits from a chamberpot, be it used for excrement or for urine 2:16) is quite explicit: “A chamberpot , he has to remove himself four cubits.” The Babli (25a) deals separately with full and empty chamberpots.. If it is before the bed, if he put some water in the pot he may recite., otherwise he may not recite. Rebbi Zakkai said, if he put a of .533 liter or about 4.5 fl. oz. U.S. of water in, he may recite; otherwise, he may not recite. How many corresponding ? One , corresponding to one , be the vessel small or large. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, if it stands behind the bed he may recite, before the bed he may not recite. Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar said, even in a dining hall, from Greek τρικλίνιον “dining room”, a hall of three dining couches arranged in U-shape. large ten-by-ten.] he may not recite until he covers it up or until he puts it under the couch. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Rebbi Ḥanina Tortayya ruled following Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar. Rebbi Benjamin ben Yephet 38b, Yerushalmi 2:5) that R. Benjamin is not trustworthy as witness to the opinions of Rebbi Yoḥanan. His statement is quoted in the Babli (25b) as original Babylonian tradition. in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: A minute amount of excrement can be eliminated by spit. Rebbi Zeïra and Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi were sitting; they saw some excrement. Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi got up and spat on it. Rebbi Zeïra said to him: From the sea to the pan 44a) and (1 טגן) explain this expression to mean: “immediately”, like a fish that has to be fried immediately before it spoils. Most commentators explain that R. Zeïra declares the entire rule invalid since spit dries quickly and afterwards is useless. The Babli avoids the problem by allowing only thick spit, probably from the bronchiae, which does not evaporate. One may consider the treatment of the Babli as answer to R. Zeïra’s criticism.! A chest full of scrolls one may put under the head of the bed but one may not put it under the foot end of the bed. Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Ḥuna: But only if the bed is 10 hand-breadths (hand-breadth) is one-sixth of a cubit. The basic information one has about length is that the distance one may travel from a town on Sabbath is one or 2000 cubits. If the is taken to be the traditional 1111m = 3648 feet then a cubit is 1.824 ft and a is 3.65 inches. (If the is taken to be an unlikely Roman mile of 1473.2m = 4833.33 ft, then a cubit is 2.417 ft and a is 4.836 inches.) Another approach is based on Mishnah 17:11 which reports an opinion that fluid measures are Roman. The Babli ( 109 a/b) defines 40 as three cubic cubits. By the data quoted in note 164, the cubit would be 55.47 cm and the 9.25 cm or 3.64 in. Anything more than 10 above the ground is considered to be in another domain. This reason also applies to the next paragraph. high, and only if the ropes of the bed do not touch the chest. Rebbi Yasa taught the ruling of Rebbi Ḥuna in the town of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac. A person should not have sexual intercourse when there is a Torah scroll with him in the room. Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: it is permitted if it was wrapped in a wrapper or if it was in a window opening that is ten hand-breadths above the ground. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi made a small curtain 25b, states the dangers of sexual intercourse in the presence of a Torah scroll; its connection with the preceding discussion of praying in presence of a chamberpot can be understood only as a commentary on the Yerushalmi.) for it. A person should not sit on a low bench “bench”. on which a Torah scroll was placed. It happened that Rebbi Eliezer sat down on a low bench on which a Torah scroll was placed and he recoiled from it as one recoils before a snake 3:13, and 3:10 (where it says “he got up as if bitten by a snake”); also quoted in Babli 32b. The reason given is the verse ( 26:6): “You shall fear My holy things.” This is then qualified that one may not sit on a bench on which there is a Torah scroll, but if the scroll is on a separate table or chair, there is no minimum distance to be kept.. If it was placed on something other, it is permitted. How far? Rebbi Abba in the name of Rebbi Ḥuna: One handbreadth. Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: Anything. A double sack full of scrolls or if there were in it bones of a dead person, one carries it on his back and rides. one may hang on the headboard of the bed but one may not hang them at the foot end of the bed. Rebbi Samuel, Rebbi Abbahu, Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: Rebbi did hang his on the headboard of his bed. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: But only that he should not do in the way of makers of palm leaf baskets but on top and the straps on the bottom should never hang down. [While דיקולא are palm-leaf baskets, the Latin ending - is suspect. It might be better to derive the word from Latin , “neck chain, collar”, with the prefix די meaning either “double” or being the Aramaic relative pronoun (E. G.). should not hang as a pendant from its chain.] In the Babli (24a), this is a rejected opinion. One requires there that the be put in a pouch, the pouch then may be hung at the head of the bed.. Rebbi Ḥalaphta ben Shaul. In the Babli, he mostly appears as Rebbi Taḥlipha ben Shaul. The section here is a continuation of the discussion of respect due to either places of holiness (the synagogue) or acts of holiness (prayer). stated: It is a bad sign if one lets wind during one’s prayer. That means on one’s bottom, but not on one’s top. This parallels what Rebbi Ḥanina said: I saw Rebbi yawning, belching, putting his hand on his mouth, but not spitting. Rebbi Yoḥanan said, one may even spit so that one’s cup should be clean; forward is forbidden, behind oneself is permitted. To one’s right is forbidden, to one’s left is permitted; that is what is written ( 91: 7): “On your left hand side will fall a thousand.” Everybody agrees about one who spits toward the stele n, Lĕšōnēnū 32 (5728), 276–277]. This passage appears in many corrupt versions in early medieval rabbinic authors (e. g., R. Abraham bar David and the student of Rabbenu Jonah) and has given rise to many phantastic conjectures., that he is forbidden to do so. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi says, he who spits in the synagogue is like one who spits into his own eye. Rebbi Jonah spat and rubbed out. Rebbi Jeremiah, Rebbi Samuel bar Ḥalaphta in the name of Rav Ada bar Aḥava: He who prayed should not spit until he walked four cubits. Rebbi Yose bar Rebbi Abun said, similarly he who spat should not pray until he walked four cubits. Similarly, he who urinates should not pray until he walks four cubits 2:19), the language is more restrictive: “A person should not urinate at the place where he prays unless he removes himself four cubits. Once he urinated he should not pray unless he removed himself four cubits. If it is dry or absorbed (in the earth) it is permitted.” This text is the basis of the discussion of the Babli ( 27b) but not of the Yerushalmi.. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said: not only that he walks four cubits but even if he waits corresponding to a walk of four cubits. Rebbi Ammi said, if you say that he is forbidden until he removes himself four cubits, I say that maybe somebody else came and urinated there 25a) explicitly rules out this argument and states that one is forbidden only at a place where certainly somebody urinated and the moisture is still recognizable.. Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav: Excrement until it is hardened like bone, urine all the time it makes moist for urine but the conclusion, that excrement is forbidden even if it is hard like bone, while supported there in the name of R. Yoḥanan, is finally rejected as a matter of common practice.. Ganiva said: All the time that its impression is visible. Samuel said: Until its surface is hardened. Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Until its surface is hardened. Rebbi Jeremiah, Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav: Excrement is forbidden even if it is hard like bone. Samuel said: Until its surface is hardened. Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Until its surface is hardened. Ḥizqiah said: Rebbi Abba is more restrictive for urine than for excrement? Rebbi Mana said to him: From that of Ganiva; he said to him: Even if it is hard like bone it is forbidden because its matter exists; urine’s matter no longer exists",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: The person with gonorrhea who had an emission of semen, as well as a menstruating woman who lost semen, and the woman who started menstruating while having intercourse, need immersion, but Rebbi Yehudah frees them 15 that the man with gonorrhea makes everything around himself impure and cannot be become pure except by a lengthy procedure. Similarly, the menstruating woman needs at least seven days for her purification. If any of these is polluted by the minor impurity of as explained in the preceding , any immersion for has no influence on the severe impurity already existing (or the one additional in the case of the woman who notices her period while she is already impure by having intercourse). Rebbi Yehudah notes that since the immersion for has no practical consequences, it is not needed. The other sages seem to think that since the immersion does not need or flowing water and since it is needed to let the persons pray it is of a completely different character and independent of the other impurities. Since the woman noticing her period during intercourse has to stop it immediately, even before emission of semen, it is clear that her impurity is not the Biblical one described in 15:16–18 but the rabbinic one of . HALAKHAH: So far the person with gonorrhea who had an emission of semen; is it good for anything if the person immerses himself who had an emission and afterwards has an episode of gonorrhea? We hear it from this: “The woman who started menstruating while having intercourse needs immersion, but Rebbi Yehudah frees her. preceded the severe Biblical impurity and, nevertheless, the disagreement between the majority and Rebbi Yehudah is the same as when the severe impurity precedes . This particular case, which is not in the Mishnah, is treated in Babli 26a where it is stated explicitly not only that Rebbi Yehudah does not require immersion but that the majority require it.” What is Rebbi Yehudah’s reason? Is it because what would one profit if he immersed himself or whether there is a name for light impurity in the presence of severe impurity? What is the difference between these possibilities? If he saw , if you say what would one profit if he immersed himself, he would profit without washing.! Hence, the only reason is that there is no name for light impurity in the presence of severe impurity! That is if the light impurity came at the end. Is it even if the severe impurity came at the end? We may understand it from this: “The woman who started menstruating while having intercourse needs immersion, but Rebbi Yehudah frees her.” That means, one case is like the other case.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Morning prayers are until noon; Rebbi Yehudah says, until four hours. Afternoon” prayers. This expression refers to the Temple service when the flour offering after the afternoon sacrifice signalled the end of the day. The preferred time fixed for this offering was 2h 30min. before sundown. Hence, “half of ” is 1h 15min. before sundown. The earliest time for the evening sacrifices (on Passover eve) was 30 minutes after noontime. prayers were added on days when there were additional public sacrifices between morning and afternoon sacrifices. prayers are until evening, Rebbi Yehudah says until half ofʹ . Evening prayers have no fixed time. prayers have all day. HALAKHAH: It is written ( 11:13) “To love the Eternal, your God, and to work 2a), prayer is explicitly qualified as “service by the heart”. for Him with all yor heart and all your soul,” does there exist work in the heart? This refers to prayer. And so it says ( 6:17): “Your God, whom you serve permanently, may rescue you.” Is there any service in Babylonia? This refers to prayer. One might think that one may pray all three 3:6) or in the Babli (31a), whose text is close to the Tosephta. The last remarks about moving one’s lips is neither in the Babli nor in the Tosephta. together - it is explained in Daniel ( 6:11): “Three times a day he fell on his knees, etc.” One might think that one may pray in any direction one wants - the verse says “slits were open for him in the direction of Jerusalem.” One might think that he started after he went into captivity - the verse says “as was his wont from before that.” One might think that one may pray all three at any time he wishes - already David did explain ( 55:18): “Morning, evening, and afternoon.” One might think that one may pray aloud - it was explained about Hannah ( 1:13): “Hannah was speaking to herself.” One might assume that he might simply think - the verse says “only her lips moved.” How is that? One whispers with one’s lips. Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina said: From this verse ( 1:13) you may learn four things. “Hannah was speaking to her heart,” from here that prayer needs attention. “Only her lips moved,” from here that one must whisper with one’s lips. “Her voice was not heard,” from here that nobody should pray at high voice. “And Eli thought that she was drunk,” from here that a drunk is forbidden to pray. The word of Ḥanan bar Abba disagrees since Ḥanan bar Abba said to the colleagues: I shall tell you one of the good things that I saw Rav do and, when I told it before Samuel he got up and kissed me on my mouth. At “praised are You”, he bows down. When he comes to mention , he straightens up. Samuel said: I shall give the reason ( 35:10): “The Lord straightens the bent ones.” Rebbi Ammi said: It is not reasonable, but ( 2:5): “Before My Name he is low.” Rebbi Abun said: If it were written “at My Name he is low” then you would be right, but it is written “before My Name he is low”, before he mentions he is low. Rebbi Abba bar Zavda prayed aloud. Rebbi Jonah prayed whispering in the synagogue; he prayed aloud in his house so that the people in his house should learn prayer from him. Rebbi Mana said: Really, the people in my father’s house learned prayer from him. From where did they learn the three prayers? Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥmani said, the next two pragraphs very shortened, in 68(11). There, the order of prayers is evening, morning, afternoon, and the afternoon prayer is: “just as You let me see the sun in the East, so may You let me see it in the West.” The form of the Midrash is appropriate for early (half an hour after noon), the form of the Talmud is appropriate for the standard , close to evening. Neither of the two texts is a corruption of the other.: According to the three times that the day changes for man. In the morning, one must say: I thank you, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that you led me from darkness to light. At , one must say: I thank you, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that just as You let me see the sun in the East, so I could see it in the West. In the evening, one must say: May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that just as I was in darkness and You led me into light, so may You lead me from darkness into light. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, meaning that the two Amoraïm quoted do not claim originality, they simply adopt pre-existing ideas. said: They learned prayers from the patriarchs. Morning prayer from our father Abraham ( 19:27): “Abraham got up early to the place where he had stood there in the presence of the Eternal.” Standing means praying, as it says ( 106:30) “Phineas stood and prayed.” prayers from our father Isaac. ( 24:63) “Isaac went out to speak on the field.” Speaking means praying, as it says ( 102:1) “A prayer of the deprived one when he faints and pours out his speech before the Eternal.” Evening prayer from our father Jacob. ( 28:11) “He entreated at the Place, pp. 268–269..” Entreaty means prayer, as it is said ( 27:18) “Please, let them entreat the Eternal of hosts.” And it says ( 7:16): “Do not lift for them (your voice in) a cry and do not entreat me.” The rabbis said, they inferred prayers from daily sacrifices. The morning prayer from the perpetual sacrifice of the morning ( 28:4): “The first lamb you should present in the morning.” prayer from the perpetual sacrifice of the evening: “And the second lamb you should present in the evening.” They did not find anything to peg evening prayers onto it and simply stated it; that is what we have stated: Evening prayers have no fixed time. prayers are all day. Rebbi Tanḥuma said: In fact, they fixed it corresponding to the consumption of limbs and fat which were consumed on the altar during the entire night. Rebbi Yehudah 17:21). The second paragraph which connects the derivation to the previous association with sacrifices, and hence, with prayer, is found only in the Yerushalmi. learned from words of the Torah, since Rebbi Ismael stated: ( 16:21) “The sun was hot and it melted,” four hours into the day. You say four hours or should it be six hours? When it says ( 18:1): “In the heat of the day”, that means at six hours. Therefore, how can I interpret: “The sun was hot and it melted,” four hours into the day! You derive it from ( 17:21): “In the morning,” ( 28:4) “in the morning.” Since the first “morning” meant “four hours”, “morning” mentioned there also means “four hours.” At four hours the sun is warm and the shadow is cool. At six hours both sun and shadow are hot. Rebbi Tanḥuma said ( 18:1): “In the heat of the day”, at an hour when there is no shadow for any creature. Rebbi Yasa prayed at three hours and prayer were separate activities, the practice in Amoraic times was to unite them. It is stated in the Babli (9b) in the name of Israeli authorities that it is preferable to pray immediately after the last benediction of . All authorities quoted here subscribe to this usage; the first two pray at the correct time for the recitation of , the last one recites at the time of prayer according to Rebbi Yehudah.. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba prayed at three hours. They saw Rebbi Berekhiah that he recited and prayed after three hours. But did we not formulate ( 1:5): “He who reads after that did not lose, he is like a man reading in the Torah.” We may say that he accepted the yoke of heaven in its time during the preliminary benedictions recited immediately after one gets dressed in the morning. Then the remainder of is just recitation of verses of Torah and may be delayed, in particular on Sabbath and holidays.. Or Rebbi Yehudah learned from testimony since Rebbi Simon said in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: In the time of the hellenistic government 64b) telescopes this story and the next into one and dates it at the civil war of the two Hasmonean brothers Hyrkanos and Aristobulos. they lowered them two boxes with gold and they gave them two lambs to pull up. Once they lowered them two boxes with gold and they gave them two kid goats to pull up. At that moment the Holy One, praise to Him, enlightened their eyes and they found two certified lambs in the hall of lambs 28:3) requires that the perpetual sacrifice be “a yearling sheep without blemish”, the sheep were usually held in a separate “hall of lambs” and were inspected three times before being used as sacrifice.. About that time did Rebbi Yehudah bar Abba 6:1, 8:2, 16:7 and that R. Yehudah ben Baba, who was killed in the aftermath of the war of Bar Kokhba, is much too late to testify about occurrences in the Temple. Hence, the name “bar Abba” should not be changed. testify that the perpetual morning sacrifice was brought at four hours. Rebbi Levi said: Also in the days of the present evil government they lowered them two boxes with gold and they gave them two sheep to pull up. Once they lowered them two boxes with gold and they let them pull up two swine 64b), there was only one swine and not only the wall but the entire Land of Israel trembled. (The civil war was at the time when Pompey conquered the East for Rome but the story here clearly speaks of the war of Titus. However, it seems that the Babli tradition in this case is more correct.). They did not manage to get to half the height of the wall when the swine clawed the wall; the wall trembled, and [the swine] jumped 40 parasangs from the Land of Israel. At that time the sins caused that the perpetual sacrifice was stopped and the Temple destroyed. What is the reason of the rabbis? ( 28:3) “Two for the day”, split the day in two. The reason of Rebbi Yehudah: “two for the day”, two advocates per day; “two for the day” that they should be slaughtered expressly for the day. “Two for the day”, that their slaughtering should be facing the day. That is what we have stated 4:1. The entire passage is in 142, in changed form Babli 62a, 31b.: The perpetual morning sacrifice was slaughtered at the Northwest corner at the second ring, facing the day 1:11)., and the evening one was slaughtered at the Northeast corner at the second ring, facing the day. And that he should know which one was to be slaughtered in the morning and which one in the evening. Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: and prayers prayer, a person has not prayed before 12:30 pm local time and now he is obligated for two prayers., the prayer has precedence. They wanted to say, that is if there is no time in the day to pray both of them; but if there is time in the day to pray both of them then the prayer has precedence. Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Even if there is time in the day to pray both of them, the prayer has precedence 114a, Yerushalmi 8:1). It is reported in the Babli (28a) that Rebbi Zeïra learned the rule not from R. Yoḥanan directly but from R. Nathan bar Ṭobi.. Rebbi Nathan bar Ṭobi in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Even if there is time in the day to pray both of them, the prayer has precedence. But did we not state: “If somebody made prayer precede prayer, he has done his duty.” Retrospectively, but from the start, not so. Explain it if the time for prayer has not yet arrived, as in the following: Rebbi Joshua ben Levi commanded his students: If you have lunch and the day progressed to six hours before you entered, then pray before you enter which is bound to rigid times, prayer may be said too early as explained later in this .. (Tosephta 3:1) How much is half of ? Eleven hours minus a quarter. There ( 5:1) we have stated: “The perpetual sacrifice is slaughtered at 8:30 hours and brought at 9:30 hours. On Passover Eve days it is sacrificed at 7:30 hours and brought at 8:30 hours, whether it be weekday or Sabbath.” Rebbi Jeremiah asked: Here is 2½ hours before night. The next “here” refers to the evening sacrifice which on ordinary days is slaughtered at 8:30 hours, 3½ hours before sundown. If the rules of prayer are derived from the rules of sacrifice then the time of prayers should be fixed at 3½ hours before sundown! you make at two and a half hours and here you make three and a half hours? Rebbi Yose said, prayer was not bound to the perpetual sacrifice of evening but to incense burning 30:8).. What is the reason? ( 141:2): “May my prayer be prepared as incense before You, the lifting up of my hands as the gift of evening.” Take one hour for its preparation and you make at two and one half hours. Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina used to pray when the sun set so that the fear of Heaven should be on him the entire day long. Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said: May my lot be with those who pray at sunset 5:1 (fol. 31c), where דמדומי חמה is the opposite of הנץ החמה “sunrise”. The same verbal stem in Arabic means “to eliminate by force.”. What is the reason? ( 32:6) “For that, every pious person should pray to You at the time of מצא”, at the time when the day is pushed out. The maternal uncle of Rebbi Ada had rolled up the kaftan of Rav on the Great Fastday and on Yom Kippur.. He said to him: When you see the sun on top of the date palms, give me my kaftan so that we may pray And when the sun is on top of the date palms it is daytime. As Rebbi Yoḥanan said ( 44:27): “He Who said to the deep: dry up!”, that is Babylonia, the filth “situation; filth”. of the world. Rebbi Yoḥanan said: 23, 12:7. In the first two, there is an additional explanation of Shinear: A land whose (Jewish) rulers study Torah as youths (but do not continue studying as adults.): Why is it called “the deep”, because there the dead of the Deluge were submerged, ( 51:49) “Also in Babylonia the slain of Israel will fall, also in Babylonia the corpses of all the earth did fall.” It is written ( 11:2) “They found a valley in the land Shinear and dwelt there.” Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, why is it called Shinear? Because there the dead of the Deluge were thrown of the root נער “to pour out”; a later explanation refers to נער “to be a youth”.. Another explanation: Because they die in strangulation, without light or public baths. Another explanation: Shinear, because they are stripped of without and without tithes. Another explanation: Shinear, because its rulers die as youths. Another explanation: Shinear, because it produced a hater and enemy of the Holy One, praise to Him. Who is that? That is Nebuchadnezzar the evil one. Rav acted according to Rebbi Yehudah. If you do it following the rabbis, Rebbi Yehudah will not agree. If you do it following Rebbi Yehudah, the rabbis also will agree. From where about ? Rebbi Levi said: ( 1:15) “Even if you prolong your prayers.” From here that everyone who increases his prayers will be answered. The argument of Rebbi Levi is inverted. There says Rebbi Abba, the son of Rebbi Pappai, Rebbi Joshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rebbi Levi ( 14:23) “In all excitement there is something superfluous; and the word of the lips is but for deficit.” Hannah, because she prayed too long, reduced the years of Samuel because she said ( 1:22) “He shall dwell there forever” but “forever” for a Levite is only 50 years, as it is written ( 8:25): “At age fifty he should return from the worshipping hosts”. But in fact it was 52, Chap.13, and is based on the assertion ( 13:1) that Saul ruled only for two years, and on certain not obvious principles of interpretation of the Bible. Shiloh was destroyed when Samuel was still relatively young and afterwards he never lived near the Tabernacle again.. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said two years until she weaned him. And here you say so? If he ever said it, one for private the other for public prayers. Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan, Rebbi Simeon bar Ḥalaphta in the name of Rebbi Meïr ( 1:12): “When she prayed very long before the Eternal,” it follows that everyone who extends his prayers will be answered. When is ? The rabbis of Caesarea say: Rav and Rebbi Yoḥanan disagree. Rav said, when the gates of Heaven are locked. And Rebbi Yoḥanan said, when the gates of the Temple are locked. Rebbi Yudan Antordaya said: A Mishnah supports Rebbi Yoḥanan ( 4:1): “On three occasions do the Cohanim lift their hands four times in one day, mornings, and at the locking of the gates: on fastdays, at support services, and on Yom Kippur. May you say that the gates of heaven are locked while it is still daytime? The maternal uncle of Rebbi Ada had rolled up the kaftan of Rav on the great fast. He said to him: When you see the sun on the top of the date palms, give me my kaftan so that we may pray the Locking of the Gates. The argument of Rav is inverted. There he says “the locking of the Gates of Heaven” and here he says “the locking of the gates of the Temple.” Rav Mattanah said: Since Rav needed a lot of time to pray, he reached the Locking of the Gates of Heaven of reciting poetic inserts was accepted, did spend the time until sundown in reciting prayers before the of This interpretation is impossible since “prayer” always means “the ”]. May free one from evening prayers? Rebbi Abba, Rav Ḥuna in the name of Rav: frees one from evening prayers may be started only when evening prayers may already be said. It does not make sense to recite two prayers at one time.. Rebbi Abba said to Rav Ḥuna: How may he mention (“distinction”) was recited in the evening . Hence, Rav’s decision seems to be impossible. (Even though it is possible, but undesirable, to recite only on a cup of wine, in particular after Yom Kippur when no fire is lit for .)? Rebbi Jonah said to Rebbi Abba: How may seven. free one from eighteen? He said to him, did I not already contradict it? He said to him: Because you contradicted it, should it be abandoned? Rebbi Yose said, what Rebbi Abba asked is truly difficult. What Rebbi Jonah asked is not at all difficult, they made it easy on people because of the fast, that seven should free one from eighteen. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal 87b) which reports the opinion of Rav that does free one from evening prayers and explains that, in the opinion of Rav, the evening is not really obligatory (and, hence, is eliminated by the contemporaneous ) is said over a cup of wine. The next statement in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi is strictly from the Land of Israel. said to his colleagues: From all of them I understand that does not free one from evening prayers. Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: does not free one from evening prayers. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said: Did not Rebbi Ḥiyya state this: “Every day one prays eighteen benedictions, including the end of Sabbath, end of Yom Kippur, and end of public fast days is a commentary on Mishnah 3; it explains the opinion of Rabban Gamliel that a full 18 benedictions have to be prayed three times every day (see the end of this Halakhah), including the end of Sabbath and Yom Kippur (against the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba that on those occasions there are 19 benedictions, including a separate benediction for ), and the end of public fasts for rain, to exclude the opinion that eliminates the evening prayer. The Israeli position is thus supported by a tannaïtic statement..” Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi prayers.: If Yom Kippur happens to be on the Sabbath, one mentions Sabbath in even though there is no for Sabbath. They added to it: If the New Moon happens to be on a public fast-day, one mentions the New Moon in even though there is no for the New Moon.. Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: On a Sabbath that falls on Ḥanukkah, one mentions Ḥanukkah for even though there is no for Ḥanukkah. They added to it the New Moon that happens to be in it, one mentions Ḥanukkah for even though there is no for Ḥanukkah 34b) is in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi only, there the reason is stated that “the day requires four (or five) prayers”, and since the addition is required for some of the prayers it is required for all of them.. When the New Moon falls on a fast day, how does one mention the New Moon 32b) and Rosh (R. Asher ben Yeḥiël, to Chap. 5, #10) felt compelled to emend the text. Since three of the four prayers of the New Moon are weekday prayers with an addition added in “Temple service” (רצה, the 16th benediction in the Yerushalmi version) as given later in Chapter 5, Halakhah 2, the only question can be about . However, we never hear that the particular inserts in the morning prayers of a fast day were recited also for . On the other hand, as Rosh points out, the previous paragraph certainly implies that the one benediction recited on fast-days except Yom Kippur, not only on those for rain, known as עננו, must be recited also for since the day requires that the benediction be inserted in all prayers. One may at least understand the position of Rebbi Abba that on a fast day for rain which coincides with a day of the New Moon, one recites the usual with an additional fifth benediction which deals with the fast day, after the fourth for the New Moon. The dissenting opinions of Rebbis Zeïra and Abba bar Mamal seem to imply that on a fast day consisted of the introductory and final benedictions that are common to all prayers and the additional benedictions for the fast day, whereas the section on the New Moon, for which is recited in the first place, is moved from its regular place to an insert in either the 16th or the 17th (מודים, “thanksgiving”, a place usually reserved for thanksgiving for past miracles) benediction.? Rebbi Zeïra said, in “thanksgiving”. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said, in “Temple service”. Rebbi Avina said, he says it as the fourth benediction. Rebbi Abba said, how do we find everywhere that he says it as the fourth benediction, here also as the fourth benediction. And so it was acted upon according to Rebbi Abba. What does one read? Rebbi Yose said, one reads blessings and curses 3:6. On the day of the New Moon, one reads abouts its sacrifices, 28:11–15 (in Babylonia, 28:1–15), and on fast days for rain, blessings and curses, 26:3–46. (In Babylonia on other fast days, 32:11–14, 34:1–10). In Babylonia there would be no problem since there two Torah scrolls were used to read both portions, giving each person a larger share to read. However, in Israel the Torah was not read in the Babylonian one-year cycle but in an irregular three-year cycle with shorter readings and where the regular reading was postponed for any special one. For example, on Sabbath Ḥanukkah, in Israel the corresponding part of the dedication sacrifices ( 7) was read, whereas in Babylonia that was simply the reading from the second Torah scroll. Similarly, for a Sabbath New Moon one read in Israel only 28:1–15 and not the regular Torah reading. Hence, there is a serious question which portion to read on the New Moon which is also a fast day.. Rebbi Mana said to him: For example to tell them about the fast day? They are lying on their bellies a penitential service (נפילת אפים) that is forbidden on semi-holidays like the day of the New Moon. and should not know that it is a fast day? He said to him: To tell you that one reads blessings and curses. Rebbi Yudan the Kappadokian said before Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Yehudah ben Pazi: One reads about the New Moon. Rebbi Yose met Rebbi Yehudah ben Pazi. He asked him: Did you hear that from your father? He said to him: My father did not say so, except that at Eyn Ṭab (καλλιρρόη “the beautifully flowing one”); it possibly is Ḥamat Gader. Since the sequence of 30 day and 29 day months was not determined beforehand, only at Eyn Ṭab was the day of the New Moon fixed. Everywhere else one knew that it was certainly a fast day and probably a day of the New Moon; the certain has precedence over the probable., since they know for sure that it is the New Moon, they read about the New Moon. Hence, at all other places one reads blessings and curses. Jeremiah the Scribe as in Babylonia. The parallel discussion of this and the next paragraph is in Babli 29b. asked before Rebbi Jeremiah: What does one read if the day of the New Moon is a Sabbath? He said to him: One reads about the New Moon. Rebbi Ḥelbo said before Rebbi Ammi: The Mishnah says so ( 3:6), “One interrupts for everything, for New Moons, for Ḥanukkah, and for Purim.” Isaac the trader asked Rebbi Isaac: What does one read on a New Moon that falls in Ḥanukkah? He said to him: Three for the New Moon and one for Ḥanukkah. Rebbi Phineas and Rebbi Simon, Rebbi Abba bar Zamina brought it in the name of Rebbi Eudaimon of Haifa 29b) he is called Rebbi Dimi.: Three read of Ḥanukka and one of the New Moon, to tell you that the fourth one comes only because of the New Moon sacrifice in the Temple. On the Sabbath, seven read (and the reads one additional portion). Hence, it seems impossible that the fourth person should read about Hanukkah.. Bar Shelemiah the scribe asked Rebbi Mana: Think of it, if the New Moon of Ḥanukkah falls on a Sabbath, do not seven read? How can you say, to tell you that the fourth one comes only because of the New Moon? They asked the scribe 4:1, 3:4) but it may be justified to assume that the question was not his, but that he was asked by others on his authority as scribe to the rabbi. Most probably, as conjectured by Levi Ginzberg, it is a second version of Rebbi Mana’s answer, that this is a really stupid question from a scribe who has not learned to think by himself: Since one interrupts for the Sabbath, it is clear that the reading of the New Moon, which occurs at least 16 times a year, has precedence over Ḥanukkah which occurs only 8 times.; he said to him: That is a true question of a scribe. Rebbi and fast days, the discussion returns to the last part of the Mishnah. The text appears in modified form also in 8:10, 23; the parallel in Babli 27b disagrees fundamentally with the practice explained here. According to the Mishnah, the time of is until 5/4 hours before sundown for Rebbi Yehudah and until sundown for the other sages. As a corollary, the time of evening prayers starts at 5/4 hours before sundown for Rebbi Yehudah and at sundown for the others. Since Rebbi was a student of Rebbi Yehudah, it is possible that he simply followed his teacher and himself was followed by his own student R. Ḥiyya. Perhaps it is assumed here that we already know the result of the next paragraph, that evening prayer is not obligatory (this is also accepted in the Babli), and that because of this one permits evening prayer before sundown because it is a minor obligation and in Galilee apparently was not recited in the synagogue. This is the medieval Ashkenazic tradition. [The Babli states that evening prayers should be said in the night, that this is also Rebbi’s position, but that in case of error, under very dark clouds, one does not have to repeat the prayer which in Babylonia was recited in the synagogue.] commanded his speaker Abdan who spoke in a loud voice. It is probable that the situation described here is that of Sabbath afternoon when everybody came to listen to the sermon, since the audience is called “congregation” and not “students”, who were the weekday audience.: Proclaim before the congregation that he who wants to pray, should pray evening prayers as long as it is still daylight. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba commanded his speaker: Proclaim before the congregation that he who wants to pray should pray evening prayers as long as it is still daylight. Rebbi Ḥanina said: Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose drew me to an inn and said to me: Here my father prayed Saturday (Friday night) prayers on Friday. Rebbi Ammi said: Rebbi Yoḥanan disagrees but he should not have disagreed since one adds from the profane to the holy time; in addition, donkey drivers come from Arab to Sepphoris and say, Rebbi Ḥanina ben Dosa already did consecrate the Sabbath in his town. But so it has been said, that Rebbi Ḥanina said: Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose drew me to an inn and said to me, here my father prayed Saturday night prayers on the Sabbath. But even with that he should not have disagreed, since Rebbi commanded his speaker Abdan: Proclaim before the congregation that he who wants to pray should pray evening prayers as long as it is still daylight. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba commanded his speaker: Proclaim before the congregation that he who wants to pray should pray evening prayers as long as it is still daylight. In the house of Rebbi Yannaï they said: If a man went to bed, one does not bother him to get up. Rebbi Zeïra said, all the time that I followed this rule, I was afraid in the night. You have only what Rebbi commanded his speaker Abdan: Proclaim before the congregation that he who wants to pray should pray evening prayers as long as it is still daylight. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba commanded etc. Rebbi Jacob bar Abba said: There, they did state, what is the status of evening prayer? Rabban Gamliel said, it is obligatory. Rebbi Joshua is obligatory. said, it is voluntary. Rebbi Ḥanina said, this difference parallels the other difference: He who holds that evening prayer is obligatory, holds that does not free one from evening prayers. He who holds that it is voluntary, holds that frees one from evening prayers. It happened that one student came and asked Rebbi Joshua: What is about evening prayer? He said to him: It is voluntary. He asked Rabban Gamliel: What is about evening prayer? He said to him: It is obligatory. He said to him: But Rebbi Joshua told me that it was voluntary. He said to him: Tomorrow, when I enter the assembly hall, stand up and ask me about this practice. The next day, this student stood up and asked Rabban Gamliel: What is about evening prayer? He said to him: It is obligatory. He said to him: But Rebbi Joshua told me that it was voluntary. Rabban Gamliel said to Rebbi Joshua: Are you the one who says it is voluntary? He answered him: No. He said to him: Stand up on your feet so that they may testify against you. Then Rabban Gamliel was sitting down and lecturing while Rebbi Joshua was standing up until the people started talking and said to Rebbi Ḥuẓpit the interpreter: Send the people home. They said to Rebbi Zenon the was not only the reader in congregational prayers, but also the general organizer of religious affairs. In outlying communities he was the ritual slaughterer and the conduit through whom questions of religious practice were addressed to the Academies. Here it seems that he had to recite the prayer at the end of a study session discussed in the next Halakhah, that it was customary to start with a Bible verse and that the people spontaneously chose one which was a curse on the speaker.: Start! He said: Start! All the people stood up and said to him ( 3:19): “Certainly, on whom did your evil not pass always?” They went and appointed Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah to the Yeshivah when he was 16 years old (In the Babli, the age is given as 18 years.) The difficulty of this age determination is discussed at length by the author in p. 265–266.; his head became all white. Rebbi Aqiba sat and was sad; he said, not that he is a greater Torah scholar than I am, but he comes from a greater family than I do; hail to the man whose forefathers created merit for him, hail to the man who has a peg to hang on to. What was Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah’s peg? He was the tenth generation after Ezra. How many seats were there when, with the deposition of Rabban Gamliel, also his elitistic exclusionary policies of admission to the Yeshivah were scrapped. The insertion is Amoraïc, as is shown by the names of the authorities and the quotes from the Mishnah. The previous paragraph and the following one are Tannaïtic.? Rebbi Jacob ben Sisi said: Eighty seats were there of accomplished scholars, not to count those standing behind the railing. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said 300 were there, not to count those standing behind the railing. As we have stated there (Mishnah 1:3) “On the day Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah was appointed to the Academy.” was presented on that day. There (Mishnah 4:6) we have stated: “This inference did Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah present before the sages at the vineyard of Jabneh.” Was there a vineyard? It means that the scholars sat there in rows like vines in a vineyard. Rabban Gamliel went immediately to pacify each one in his house. He came to Rebbi Joshua and found him occupied with the making of needles. He asked him: This is how you earn your living? He answered him: Until now you did not know? Woe to the generation whose caretaker you are! He said to him: I humble myself before you. They sent a washerman to Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah, but some say that it was Rebbi Aqiba. He told him: The sprinkler, son of a sprinkler, should sprinkle. Should anyone who is neither a sprinkler nor the son of a sprinkler say to the sprinkler: your water is water from a cave and your ashes are ashes from a fireplace? He said to him: You made your peace with him! I and you shall go in the morning to Rabban Gamliel’s door. Nevertheless they did not remove him from his dignity but made him head of the court.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Rebbi Neḥoniah ben Haqqanah and many mystical teachings. used to recite a short prayer when he entered and when he left the house of study. They asked him, what kind of prayer is this? He told them: When I enter, I pray that no mishap should come through me and when I leave I give thanks for my lot. HALAKHAH: What does he say when he enters? May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that I should not be offended by my colleagues and my colleagues should not be offended by me; that we should not declare impure that which is pure, nor declare pure what is impure; that we should not forbid that which is permitted, nor permit what is forbidden and I would be ashamed in this world and the world to come. What does he say when he leaves? I thank You, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You ordained my lot with those who sit in the house of study and in synagogues and You did not ordain my lot in theaters and circuses imply that Rebbi Neḥonia accepted the doctrine of predestination as conjectured by L. Finkelstein (מבוא לפרקי אבות ואבות דרבי נתן, ניו יורק תשי״א, נספח ב).. For I toil and they toil, I am diligent and they are diligent. I toil to inherit the Garden of Eden, but they toil for the pit of destruction as it is said ( 16:10): “Certainly, You will not abandon my soul to the pit, You will not let Your pious ones see destruction.” Rebbi Pedat in the name of Rebbi Jacob bar Idi is given in the Babli, 16b–17a, where a different text appears in the name of Rebbi Eleazar. It is remarkable that Rebbi Pedat, son of Rebbi Eleazar (ben Pedat), gives his father’s text in the name of Rebbi Jacob bar Idi, student of Rebbi Yoḥanan and colleague of Rebbi Eleazar, rather than from his own knowledge of his father’s practices. He also emphasizes that his father prayed three times, including evening prayers, as noted in the previous Halakhah.: Rebbi Eleazar used to recite three prayers. What did he say after his prayer? May it please You, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that nobody should come to hate us in his heart nor should we hate anybody in our hearts, that nobody should be envious of us nor we envious of anybody. May Your Torah be our occupation all the days of our life and may our words be supplications before You. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba added: Make our hearts singleminded in the fear of Your name, remove us from all You hate and bring us close to all You love, and deal with us in charity for Your name’s sake. In the house of Rebbi Yannai they say: He who awakes from his sleep must say “Praised are You, o Eternal, Who resurrects the dead. My Lord, I sinned before You. May it please You, o Eternal, my God, that You might give me a good heart, good part, good inclinations, good hope, good repute, benevolent eye, good soul, meek soul and meek spirit. Your Name should not be desecrated by us; do not make us a byword in the mouths of all creatures; our future should not end in destruction, nor our hope in sorrow. Do not let us need the gifts of flesh and blood, do not deliver our subsistence into the hands of flesh and blood, for their gifts are small but the shame is big. Give our part in Your Torah with those who do Your will, build Your house, Your Temple, Your city, Your Sanctuary quickly, in our days of Rav Amram Gaon. In modern prayer rites, the corresponding Babylonian prayer (Babli 60b) is universally accepted.. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba prayed: May it please You, o Eternal, our God and God of our fathers, that You may put into our hearts to do complete repentance before You so that we should not be ashamed before our forefathers in the World to Come. Rebbi Yudan ben Rebbi Ismael made it permanent that his Amora should say this after his explanations. Rebbi Tanḥum the scholar prayed: May it please You, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You may break and remove the yoke of evil inclinations from our hearts since so You created us to do Your will, and we are required to do Your will. You desire it and we desire it, who obstructs? The sour matter in the dough! It is obvious and known that we have no power to resist. But may it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You may remove it from us, subdue it, so that we may do Your will as our own with a willing heart. Rebbi Yoḥanan prayed: May it please You, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You may make dwell in our marriage couches love and understanding, peace and friendship. Let our end suceed in future and hope, increase the students in our boundaries. May we enjoy our part in paradise; grant us a good heart and a good colleague; may we get up and find, and may the quiet of our minds come before You in kindness. “When I leave I give thanks for my lot.” Rebbi Abun said, to God Who alotted me knowledge and good works.",

Rebbi Aqiba says, if he is fluent in his prayer then he prays eighteen benedictions, otherwise similar to eighteen benedictions. HALAKHAH: And why 18 1, and from there in other Midrashim. The Babli (28b) has a shorter list with different names; many allusions given here are not in that list.? Rebbi Joshua ben Levi says, corresponding to the 18 psalms that are written from the start of Psalms to ( 20:2): “May the Lord listen to you on the day of need.” If somebody would say to you they are 19, tell him ( 2:1) “Why are the Gentiles in upheaval” is not in the count 116 is divided in two.. From here they said that one who prayed and was not answered needs to fast. Rebbi Mana said, a hint that a Torah student must say to his teacher: May your prayers be answered 20:2 is adressed to David by his students (or the Synhedrion).. Rebbi Simon said, corresponding to the 18 bones in the spine since when a person prays he has to bend all of them bowing down. What is the reason? ( 35:10) “All my bones shall say, o Eternal, who is like You?” Rebbi Levi said, corresponding to the 18 Divine Names written in ( 29) “Give to the Eternal, o sons of the mighty.” Rebbi Ḥuna said: If it were said that they are 17, tell him the one against sectarians the Sages fixed already at Jabneh prayer consisted of only 17 benedictions. Rebbi Ḥuna’s answer, not very satisfactory, is that the eighteenth benediction is also an institution of the Synhedrion, the legal successor of the Great Assembly, and, therefore, all eighteen benedictions have the same status.. Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yose objected before Rebbi Yose, but is it not written ( 29:3) “the God of Glory thundered”? He said to him: Has it not been stated: He takes together the one against sectarians and sinners in “He Who subdues offenders”, the one for elders and proselytes in “Assurance to the righteous”, and the one for David in “He Who builds Jerusalem.” Then you have enough to have a Divine name/ and soft ד // (voiced ) were almost indistinguishable. for each one of them. Rebbi Ḥanina in the name of Rebbi Phineas: Corresponding to the eighteen times the Patriarchs are mentioned together in the Torah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. If somebody will tell you that there are nineteen, tell him that ( 23:13) “Behold, the Eternal was standing over him” is not counted. If somebody will tell you that there are seventeen, tell him that ( 48:16) “My name should be called over them, as well the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac” is counted. Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥmani in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Corresponding to the eighteen times “commandment” is mentioned in the second description of the tabernacle. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, only from ( 38:23) “And with him Aholiab ben Aḥisamakh” to the end of the book. The seven There is no need to ask for a reason for the seven benedictions of a holiday since holidays in everything imitate the Sabbath. In the Babli (29a) only the first reason is given, in the name of R. Ḥalaphta ben Shaul. In a quoted in #863, the seven voices are said to refer to the seven kinds of voices heard at the theophany at Sinai, which was on a Sabbath. of Sabbath, from where? Rebbi Isaac said, corresponding to the seven “voices” written in ( 29) “Give to the Eternal, o sons of the mighty.” Rebbi Yudan Antoraya said, corresponding to the seven Divine Names in ( 92) “Psalm, Song for the Sabbath Day.” Nine of New Year’s Day, from where? Rebbi Abba from Carthage said: Corresponding to the nine Divine Names in Hanna’s prayer; there it is written at the end: ( 2:10) “The Eternal will judge the ends of the earth.” The twenty-four of fast days, from where? Rebbi Ḥelbo and Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Naḥman both say, corresponding to the twenty-four times that entreaty, prayer, and supplication are mentioned in Solomon’s prayer ( 8). Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Jeremiah, a private person has to mention the occasion on a public fast day (fol. 65c). They are inserted here because the 24 benedictions of fast days were mentioned. On the other hand, the correspondences to the 18, 7, and 9 benedictions on other days belong here and are repeated in only because of the following text. The 24 benedictions are recited by the reader in public prayer. In the Babli ( 13b–14a) the opinion quoted here in the name of Rav Jeremiah (bar Abba, one of the most important students of Rav in Babylonia) is attributed to Rav himself.. Where does he say it? Between “Redeemer of Israel” and “Healer of the sick.” What does he say? “Answer us, o Eternal, answer us in this time and season because we are in great trouble, do not hide Your presence from us, do not be oblivious to our supplications, because You, o Eternal, will answer in time of trouble, redeem and save in any time of distress. ( 107.6) “They cried to the Eternal in their trouble, He led them out from their distress.” Praise to You, o Eternal, Answering in times of trouble. Rebbi Yannai ben Rebbi Ismael 65c. Rebbi Yannai ben R. Ismael was a student of R. Yoḥanan and a colleague of R. Zeïra. (The Venice text here has בשם instead of בר.) in the name of the House of Rebbi Yannai says: In “He Who hears prayer.” Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rav: Even an individual who decreed a fast day on himself has to mention the occasion. Where does he say it? Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Ḥuna: Similar to Friday night and Sabbath day. Rebbi Mani said: I, who did not check whether one follows Rav Jeremiah or Rebbi Yannai the son of Rebbi Ismael, went to the study hall and I heard: “Rav Ḥuna in the name of Rav: Even an individual who decreed a fast day on himself has to mention the occasion. Rebbi Yose objected that a disagrees: Every day one prays eighteen benedictions, including the night after Sabbath and the nights after Yom Kippur and after Public Fasts.” Since Rebbi Yose said, this disagrees contradicts Rav, he takes the to mean that a private person recites 18 benedictions on weekdays, 19, even on fast days. The additional days are mentioned to point out that insertions for a private person are always accomodated in an existing benediction, never as an additional one, in contrast to the opinion of R. Aqiba who states in Mishnah 5:2 that Saturday nights is a separate benediction. In addition, it is stated that on those days when is recited, Yom Kippur and fast days for a severe draught, the prayer does not replace the following night’s prayer as discussed in Halakhah 1. The Yerushalmi does not address the question what the reader says on a public fast day which is not a fast for rain; the Babli decides that the reader will recite עננוּ as a separate benediction between “Redeemer of Israel” and “Healer of the sick.” This decision does not go against R. Mani’s argument., it contradicts the statement: between “Redeemer of Israel” and “Healer of the sick.” Rebbi Aḥa bar Isaac in the name of the older Rebbi Huna of Sepphoris: An individual must mention the occasion on the Ninth of Av. What does he say? “Have mercy, o Eternal, our God, in Your great mercy and your trusted kindness, towards us, Your people Israel, Your city Jerusalem, Zion the dwelling place of Your glory, and on the mourning, ruined, destroyed, and desolate city that is given into the hand of strangers, trampled down by haughty peoples, that was inherited by legions and desecrated by idol worshippers, when You had given her to Your people Israel as property, and let her be inherited by the seed of Yeshurun, for in fire You set her on fire and with fire You will build her in the future as it has been said ( 2:9): “But I shall be for her, says the Eternal, a wall of fire around, and Glory I shall be in her midst.” Rebbi Eudaimon of Sepphoris asked before Rebbi Mana: Where does one say this? He said to him: You still do not understand? Anything for the future one says in “Service” and anything about the past one says in “Thanksgiving”. The Mishnah ( 9:6) says as much: “One gives thanks for the past and cries about the future.” What are “seven similar to eighteen”? Rav says the end of each benediction and Samuel says the head of each benediction. Some formulate “seven similar to eighteen” and some formulate “eighteen similar to eighteen.” He who says “seven similar to eighteen” supports Samuel, he who says “eighteen similar to eighteen” supports Rav. Rebbi Zeïra sent Rebbi Naḥum to Rebbi Yannai ben Rebbi Ismael and said to him: What are the “seven similar to eighteen” of Samuel? He said to him: Give us understanding, have pleasure in our repentance, forgive us, redeem us, heal our sicknesses, bless our years [Rebbi Ḥaggai said, in the rainy season one says: with blessed rains, in the season of dew one says: with blessed dew 19 words) and the winter prayer is long (in Rabbenu Saadia’s 48 words) and this change is not adaptable to the short prayer. In contrast, in the Ashkenazic tradition based on Yerushalmi sources, the difference between summer and winter prayer is just two words. One may note that the French from the school of Rashi combines the Babylonian text of הביננו with the Israeli versions for summer and winter and, hence, allows the short prayer for the entire year following the Jerusalem Talmud.], for You gather in the dispersed, Yours it is to judge the misguided, put down Your hand on the wicked, but in You may rejoice all who hope for You to rebuild Your city, to renew Your Temple with the offspring of Your servant David, because before we call You will answer as it is said ( 65:24): “It shall be before they call that I shall answer, they still shall be talking while I will listen.” Praise to You, o Eternal, Who hears prayer. And he says the first three and the last three benedictions. And he says ( 28:6): Praised be the Eternal, Who certainly hears the voice of my supplications.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Rebbi Eliezer says: If one makes his prayers fixed, his prayer is not a supplication. Rebbi Joshua says: He who passes through a place of danger recites a short prayer (similar to eighteen prayers) as explained here later by (the Babylonian!) Rav Ḥisda, but in Babylon it is interpreted as an independent prayer that must be complemented by a full once the danger has passed. and says: Help, o Eternal, your people Israel; in all passing situations may their needs be before You. Praised are You, o Eternal, Who hears prayer (and entreaties). HALAKHAH: “Rebbi Eliezer says: If one makes his prayer fixed, his prayer is not supplication.” Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: Only that one should not be like one who reads a letter. Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Yose: One has to say something new every day 2:13) “do not make your prayer קבע” appears in 17:8 as “do not make your prayer (idle) talk”; this agrees with the interpretation of Rebbi Eleazar.. Aḥitophel used to say three new prayers every day. Rebbi Zeïra said: Any time that I was trying to do that, I was committing errors. Therefore, one has only what Rebbi Abbahu said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: Only that one should not be like one who reads a letter. Rebbi Eleazar used to say a new prayer every day. Rebbi Abbahu used to recite a new benediction every day prayer and R. Aḥa for any of the permanent benedictions, possibly those to be recited in the morning before prayer.. Rebbi Yose from Sidon in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Before one’s prayer one says ( 51:17) “Master, open my lips that my mouth may proclaim Your praise.” After one’s prayer, one says ( 19:15): “May the sayings of my mouth be agreeable and the thoughts of my heart, before You, my Rock and my Redeemer.” Rebbi Yudan used to say both of them before his prayer. If one was praying and remembered that he already had prayed, Rav says, he cuts short, and Samuel says, he does not cut short. Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: If only one would pray the whole day long, why, because prayer is never in vain. Rebbi Zeïra asked before Rebbi Yose: Did not Rebbi Yoḥanan say that if one is in doubt whether he did pray or not, that he should not pray? He did not give him an answer. Rebbi Abbahu came in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: If one is in doubt whether he did pray or not, he should not pray. Rebbi Ḥanina did not say so but: They asked before Rebbi Yoḥanan, if one is in doubt whether he did pray or not? He told them, if only one would pray the whole day long, why, because prayer is never in vain. If one was standing praying on the Sabbath; he forgot about the Sabbath and prayed for weekday. Rebbi Ḥuna said, Rav Naḥman bar Jacob Rabba bar Abuh, who became his father-in-law and appointed Rav Naḥman as chief judge of the Jews in Babylonia. Hence, the opinions of Rav Naḥman have the weight of Supreme Court decisions in all money matters. He is reported in the Babli (21a) to require that the benediction that was started must be finished. The contrary opinion, which therefore must be attributed to Rav Sheshet, is not mentioned in the Babli. and Rav Sheshet disagree, one says he cuts the benediction short and the other says, he finishes the benediction. All agree that he finishes “Gracious Giver of knowledge”. This follows Rebbi, since Rebbi said: I wonder why they eliminated “Gracious Giver of knowledge” on Sabbath; if there is no knowledge, from where comes prayer? Rebbi Isaac said: Knowledge is great because it is in the middle between two mentions of divine names as it is said ( 2:3): “Certainly, a God of knowledge is the Eternal”. Some want to understand from here (2:5): “Then you will understand the fear of the Eternal and the knowledge of God you will find.” Rebbi Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: Any travel is presumed to be dangerous. Rebbi Yannai, when he went abroad, commanded his household. Rebbi Mana commanded his household when he went to a bathhouse that was heated. Rebbi Ḥanina the son of Rebbi Abbahu, Rebbi Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Every sickness is presumed to be dangerous. Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Assi: Everything that the representative of the congregation passes by before the Ark and requests the needs of Your people before You. Rebbi Phineas, Rebbi Levi, Rebbi Yoḥanan, in the name of Menaḥem from Gallia: He does not say to the one who steps before the Ark “come and pray for us” but “come and present our presentation or replacing the prayer, as recognized by L. Ginzberg. Religious poetry was very important in Israel in these times; in Babylonia it was banned from synagogues except in the Yeshivah of Rav who was trained in Galilee. Hence, the Babylonian Talmud could not accept the interpretation given here., work our needs, wage our wars, pacify for us.” Others say 3:7. The statement that practice follows this text is Rav Huna’s in the Babli.: “The needs of Your people are many and their minds are dull. May it be pleasure before You, o Eternal, our God and God of our fathers, that You may give every single creature its needs and to every single body according to his want. ( 28:6) Praised be the Eternal, certainly He heard the sound of my supplications. Praised are You, o Eternal, Who hears prayer.” Rav Ḥisda said: Practice follows “others”. Rav Ḥisda said, the first and last three benedictions; see the commentary to the Mishnah.. Some Tannaïm have stated: One should first pray and then ask for one’s personal needs. Some Tannaïm have stated: One should first ask for one’s personal needs and then pray. 7b, the first opinion is R. Joshua’s, the second one R. Eliezer’s. [If the Yerushalmi had mentioned the names, the order of the would have been inverted.] R. Joshua, whose opinion always prevails against R. Eliezer, requires that private prayers be said following completion of the prescribed 18 benedictions. This is accepted as a possible practice in Babli 8a. He who says, one should first pray and then ask for one’s personal needs ( 102:1) “Prayer of the deprived one who wraps himself up” and afterwards “and before the Eternal he pours out his speech.” But he who says, one should first ask for one’s personal needs and then pray, ( 8:28) “To listen to lamentation 31a) is forced to re-interpret רנה as “prayer”.” and after that “and to prayer.” The opinion of the sages: Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Ḥuna, the private person asks for his personal needs in “He Who hears prayer”. Rebbi Abba, Rebbi Ḥiyya, in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: A person has to pray at a place that is dedicated for prayer. What is the reason? ( 20:24) “At every place where I shall let My name be mentioned.” It does not say “where you will mention” but “at every place where I shall let My name be mentioned.” Rebbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanina said: A person has to select a fixed place in the synagogue where he prays. What is the reason? ( 15:32) “David came to the top”, it does not say “where he prostrated himself before God” but “where he was used to prostrate himself before God.” Rebbi Yasa, Rebbi Ḥelbo. Rebbi Berekhiah, Rebbi Ḥelbo comes to it in the name of Rebbi Eudaimon from Ḥaifa: A person has to turn his face to the wall in order to pray. What is the reason? ( 38:2) “Hezekiah turned his face to the wall.” Which wall did he lift his eyes to? Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, he lifted his eyes to Raḥab’s wall, ( 2:15) “For her house was on the wall of the fortification.” He said before Him: Master of the world, Raḥab the inn-keeper saved two souls for You, and see how many souls You saved for her. [That is what is written (6:23): “The youths came, etc.” Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai said, even if her family was 200 persons strong and they furthermore were related to another 200 families, all of these were saved by her merit and deposited them outside of the camp of Israel.” One would have expected “all her family” but it says “all her families”..] My forefathers who brought to You all these proselytes, so much more. Rebbi Ḥananiah bar Pappus said, he lifted his eyes to the wall of the Temple. ( 43:8) “When they put their lintel next to My lintel, their doorposts next to My doorpost, with the wall between Me and them.” They were important people, they could not go and pray in the Temple every time, so they prayed in their house and the Holy One, praise to Him, considers it as if they had prayed in the Temple. My fathers who built for You all this glory, so much more. Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman said, he lifted his eyes to the wall of the woman from Sunem, as it was said ( 4:10): “Let us make a small upper storey on the wall”. He said before Him: Master of the world, the woman from Sunem made one wall for Elisha and You revived her son. My forefathers who built for You all this glory, so much more that You should give me my life. The rabbis say, he lifted his eyes to the walls of his heart. ( 4:19) “My innards, my innards I make tremble, the walls of my heart are in uproar.” He said before Him: Master of the world, I checked all my 248 limbs 1:8 where they are all enumerated in anatomic detail. that You gave me and I did not find one of them I offended You with; so much more that You should give me my life.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If one was riding on a donkey, he should descend. If he cannot descend, he should turn his head; if he cannot even turn his head, he should focus his intent towards the Holiest of Holies. If he was riding in a ship or on a raft, he should focus his intent towards the Holiest of Holies. HALAKHAH: It has been stated 3:18, Babli 30a (in slightly changed wording).: One who was riding on a donkey, if he has somebody to hold his donkey, he should descend and pray on the ground, otherwise he should pray where he is. Rebbi says, in any case he should pray where he is because then his mind will be at peace 1: He should not descend because he will be worried about valuables he has on the donkey or because of Gentiles.. Rebbi Judah ben Pazi in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Practice follows Rebbi. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa: It has been stated there, in all directions one does not stop him except in the Eastern direction 25a).. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said, as of old ( 8:16): “Their backs to the Temple of the Eternal and their faces turned East, they were prostrating themselves Eastwards before the sun.” It has been stated 3:13–16 and Babli 30a; the entire text to the end of the Halakhah is in 4:11 with minor deviations. The tradition of the verses is somewhat garbled in order to make the point of the derivation clearer.: One who is blind and one who cannot determine directions should have in mind to pray to Heaven as it is said ( 8:44) “They shall pray to the Eternal”. Those who are praying outside the Land turn their faces towards the Land of Israel. What is the reason? ( 8:48) “They will pray to You through their Land that You gave to their forefathers.” Those who are praying in the Land of Israel turn their faces towards Jerusalem. What is the reason? ( 6:34) “They shall pray to You by way of this city that You chose.” Those who are praying in Jerusalem turn their faces towards the Temple Mount, as it is said ( 8:48): “And the Temple that I built for Your Name.” Those who are praying on the Temple Mount turn their faces towards the Holiest of Holies. What is the reason? ( 8:30) “They will pray to this place and You will hear at Your dwelling place in Heaven, You will hear and forgive.” Those who stand North will be facing South, those who stand South will be facing North, those who stand East will be facing West, those who stand West will be facing East. It turns out that all of Israel pray towards one place. That is what is written ( 56:7) “For My house will be called a house of prayer for all people.” Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said: ( 6:17) “That is the Temple לִפְנָי”, Inside really seems to mean what Rabbinic לִפְנִים “inside” expresses. [There is an expression in the Babylonian Talmud for the Holiest of Holies, לפני ולפנים, which probably should be vocalized לִפְנָי וְלִפְנִים, based on this Yerushalmi.] The explanation here suggests to read לִפְנָי as shorthand for לְפָנִים פּוֹנִים, “for faces to turn.”. A Temple towards which all turn. So far when it is standing. In its destruction, from where? Rebbi Abun said ( 4:4): “Built for ”, a mound (תל) on which all mouths (פיות) pray, in Grace, recitation of , and . In Grace, “Builder of Jerusalem”. In , “God of David Who builds Jerusalem”. In the recitation of , “He Who spreads a hut of peace over us and His people Israel, Consoler of Zion and Builder of Jerusalem. on Sabbaths and holidays. The entire benediction was the Yerushalmi version for everyday. The phrase “Consoler of Zion” is missing in the Leyden manuscript and Venice print but it is in the Rome manuscript and Genizah fragments and is supported by what is known of the Israeli prayer rites in the times of the Cairo Genizah.” One verse says ( 5:19) “I shall go, I shall return to My place”. Another verse says ( 9:3) “My eyes and attention shall be there forever.” How is that? One’s face upwards, one’s eyes and attention downwards 105b, replaces the verse from Hosea by one from Threni. The ruling here is credited there to R. Yose the Tanna.) The two verses speak of God. The first asserts that God has left the earth and is found only in Heaven, the second that God’s attention is always given to the Temple here on earth. Since prayer adresses God, it is necessary to adress it in the correct direction and how can one pray in two distinct directions?. “And if not he should focus his intent towards the Holiest of Holies.” Toward which Holiest of Holies? The Great Rebbi Ḥiyya: towards the Heavenly Holiest of Holies. Rebbi Simeon ben Ḥalaphta said, towards the earthly Holiest of Holies. Rebbi Phineas said, they do not disagree, the earthly Holiest of Holies corresponds to the Heavenly Holiest of Holies. ( 15:16) “A base for Your throne”, corresponding to Your throne. ( 3:1) On Mount Moriah 55(9); a very shortened version is in Babli 16a. מוֹריה is taken either from the root הוֹרה “to teach, direct” or from מוֹרָא “fear”. ארוֹן is taken either as abstractum from אוֹר “light” or from ארה “to curse” (the unbelievers). The use of דִּבֵּר “Divine inspiration” in the explanation of דביר is from 5:13. דבר denoting one of the Ten Commandments is found in 4:13.. The Great Rebbi Ḥiyya and Rebbi Yannai, one of them said that from there teaching goes out to the world, the other one said that from there fear goes out to the world. Ark. The Great Rebbi Ḥiyya and Rebbi Yannai, one of them said that from there light goes out to the world, the other one said that from there curse goes out to the world. Temple Hall. Rebbi Ḥiyya and Rebbi Yannai, one of them said that from there inspiration goes out to the world, the other one said that from there the commandments go out to the world. is the same as σχεδία, which is the same as . ( 2:15) “We shall bring them to you as rafts.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah says, prayer is said only in an organized community, but the Sages say, with and without an organized community. Rebbi Yehudah says in his name cannot be recited outside an organized community. According to Rebbi Yehudah, has to be recited everywhere, but in a town with an organized synagogue it is enough to listen to the public prayer of the reader that he recited without a corresponding silent prayer of the congregation., at any place where there is an organized community a private person is free from reciting prayers. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Bibi in the name of Rebbi Ḥana: Practice follows Rebbi Yehudah who said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah. What we know of Samuel means the same; for Samuel said: I never prayed except once when the son of the died and there was no public prayer, then I prayed. The words of the rabbis disagree since Rebbi Jacob bar Idi said in the name of Rebbi Simeon the pious: For shepherds and field guards by themselves since they were uneducated and prayerbooks were unknown at the time. Other uneducated people can attend the synagogue and fulfill their duty by attentively follow the reader’s repetition of the prayer word-by-word, but not shepherds and watchmen; hence a way has to be found to help them.. Hence, the Mishnah spoke only for shepherds and field guards; therefore, everybody else is obliged. The words of Rebbi Yoḥanan agree since Rebbi Yoḥanan said: I saw Rebbi Yannai standing in the market of Sepphoris praying; then he walked four cubits and prayed prayer, is in Babli 30b. In both Talmudim, it is clear that the sages who reject R. Yehudah’s tradition are Galilean in the tradition of R. Yannai.. Is there no organized community in Sepphoris? You infer from this three conclusions. You infer that the markets of Sepphoris have the status of Sepphoris. You infer that one disagrees with Rebbi Yehudah who spoke in the name of Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah. You infer that a person may pray, walk four cubits, and then pray . Rebbi Abba said, not necessarily four cubits but even if he waited the time necessary to walk four cubits. Rav says, one must change the text sacrifices are distinct for every holiday, the prayer must accomodate this distinction., but Samuel says, one does not have to change the text. Rebbi Zeïra asked before Rebbi Yose: What is the practice, to change the text? He said to him: even if one said only: “And we shall bring before You what is our duty, the perpetual sacrifice of the day and the sacrifices sacrifices but the language is uniform for all holidays. A prayer is acceptable if the sentence quoted here is the only addition to the prayer for holidays, cf. Ezra Fleischer, תפילה ומנהגי תפילה ארץ־ישראליים בתקופת הגניזה, Jerusalem 1988.”, he has satisfied his duty. Rebbi Shila in the name of Rav Ḥananel: If he had prayed and found ten people who were praying, he prays with them. Rebbi Zeïra and Rav Naḥman bar Jacob were sitting. After they had prayed there came prayer. Rav Naḥman bar Jacob got up and prayed. Rebbi Zeïra said to him: Did we not pray already? He said to him: I pray and pray again, since Rebbi Shila said in the name of Rav Ḥananel: If he had prayed and found ten people who were praying, he would pray with them. Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Jonah, in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: If one had said the morning prayers and came and found them praying , he prays with them. If he did not pray the morning prayers and came and found them praying , if he knows that he may start and finish. before the reader begins and he can answer “Amen”, he may start, otherwise he may not start. About prayer that has only seven benedictions, the paragraph is out of place. It is copied word by word from Halakhah 3:2. which “Amen” did they talk? Two Amoraïm, one says the Amen of “the holy King” and the other says the Amen of “He Who listens to prayer”. Rebbi Phineas said, they do not disagree. He who said: the Amen of “the holy King”, on Sabbath, and he who said: the Amen of “He Who listens to prayer”, on weekdays. There. The entire piece is from the end of tractate ; at two places where the text of the Venice print here deviates from the one in , the text follows the latter version. (The first, “Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel” instead of “Rabban Gamliel” is a clear scribal error, the second אתת for את is an echo of the previous story of R. Zeïra and Rav Naḥman.) we have stated: Rabban Gamliel says, the reader frees the public from their obligation prayer of New Year’s day which contains nine benedictions; each of the middle benedictions requires the quoting of at least 10 verses from the Bible. In the absence of prayerbooks, that prayer was possible only for learned specialists. In the time of later Gaonim (, p. 68–69), two different Babylonian practices are reported. One, which seems to be alluded to in Babli 35a, is that individuals first prayed a silent prayer of the usual seven benedictions for holidays and then listened to the nine benedictions of the reader (with shofar blowing) from beginning to end. The second, which seems to be alluded to here, was that there was no silent prayer at all on .. The older Rebbi Huna from Sepphoris in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Practice follows Rabban Gamliel for the prayer accompanying the blowing of the Shofar of Rosh Hashanah. From the statement of Rebbi Huna it seems that Rabban Gamliel held that a private person, even if educated, never needs to pray if he listens attentively to the reader in the synagogue. This remains a conjecture in the Babli ( 34b–35a).. Rebbi Zeïra and Rav Ḥisda were sitting there for the blowing of the Shofar. After they finished the prayer for themselves but listened to the reader from start to end., Rav Ḥisda got up and prayed. Rebbi Zeïra said to him: Did we not pray just now? He said to him, I prayed and I am repeating the prayer, because Westerners came down and said in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Practice follows Rabban Gamliel for the prayer accompanying the blowing of the Shofar, but I was inattentive. If I had been attentive, I would have fulfilled my duty. Rebbi Zeïra said, that is fine from memory.. All Tannaïm are not the teachers of the Mishnaic period but the people who memorize Mishnah and to recite them in the Yeshivah when they are needed. state it in the name of Rabban Gamliel, Rebbi Hoshaia states it in the name of the Sages. Rebbi Ada from Caesarea in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: This is only if he attended from the start. Rebbi Tanḥum said, the Mishnah 4:5, implying that the prayer is valid only if it is recited in the correct order. Hence, it is valid for the listener only if he listened in the correct order, starting from the very first word. expresses this: The order of benediction, one says “Forefathers”, “Greatness”, and “Sanctification of the Name”.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: One starts to pray only in a serious frame of mind. The first waited one hour before praying in order to be able to concentrate. Even if the king greets one, he should not respond. Even if a snake is wound around one’s heel, he should not interrupt. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Abba: Prayer is forbidden to him who comes from a trip. What is the reason? ( 51:21) “Listen to that, poor woman, drunk and not from wine., is forbidden to a drunk. The parallel in the Babli ( 65a) even notes that after a lengthy caravan trip one needs three days to get one’s thoughts together.” Rebbi Zeriqan, Rebbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rebbi Eliezer, son of Rebbi Yose the Galilean: Prayer is forbidden to one in pain; is that not our verse: “Listen to that, poor woman, drunk and not from wine”? It is stated 31a), and the Tosephta (3:21). The main difference in formulation is between the Tosephta and the Talmudim, since the Tosephta requires that one start prayer מתיך דברים של חכמה. In Mishnaic Hebrew, as in Modern Sephardic Hebrew usage, the is the rabbi, and are halakhic rulings; as in the following paragraph, practices universally accepted and not subject to doubt or discussion. From the order of the Yerushalmi it seems that in practice the text of the Yerushalmi should be interpreted as implying the statement of the Tosephta. The tradition of the Babli is uncertain; see , p. 160, note ר. The Venice print of the Babli requires that one start prayer “out of joy over commandments”. Rashi, the Munich manuscript of the Babli, Halakhot Gedolot and the students of Rabbenu Jonah have simply “out of joy.” The Koronel manuscript and have “out of joy of Torah”, parallel to the Yerushalmi. A Florence manuscript that is typically Sephardic has “out of joy of Halakhah”, directly parallel to the Tosephta. Rabbenu Asher ben Yeḥiel (Rosh) has “out of words of joy”; the insistence on “words” is parallel to Yerushalmi and Tosephta. While the Babli in the printed version would refer to the state of mind required for the , as implied in the two rulings preceding this Tosephta in the Yerushalmi, the Tosephta and the Yerushalmi require the correct state of mind before one starts with the preparatory sections of prayer, even preceding the recitation of . This seems also to be confirmed by the preparatory prayer reported later by R. Ḥizqiah in the name of R. Abbahu. Most of the variants of the Babli text would demand an interpretation similar to that of the Tosephta. All three versions agree that one should start afternoon prayers with a word of Torah or Halakhah directly before the .: “One should pray neither out of conversation, nor out of jokes, nor out of frivolities, nor out of idle occupations, but out of words of Torah. Similarly, one should not take leave from one’s friend either out of conversation, or out of jokes, or out of frivolities, or out of idle occupations, but out of words of Torah, since we find that the earlier prophets were closing their words with expressions of praise and consolation.” Rebbi Eleazar said, except for Jeremiah who closed with words of reprobation. Rebbi Yoḥanan said to him, still he closed with words of consolation and said ( 51:64) “So Babylon shall sink.” Because Jeremiah continued to prophesy about the Temple. One could think that he closed with the destruction of the Temple, but the verse states ( 51:64) “So far the words of Jeremiah,” he finished with the downfall of its destroyers, he did not close with words of reprobation. But is it not written ( 66:24): “They will be a horror for all flesh?” That verse deals with Gentiles. But is it not written ( 5:22): “But You much despised us”? ( 5:21) “Make us return” replaces “But You much despised us”. Also Elijah did take leave from Elisha only out of words of Torah, ( 2:11) “they walked talking.” What did they talk of? Rebbi Aḥawa the son of Rebbi Zeïra, a memorizer of tannaitic material, in his father’s Yeshivah. The entire section is a digression induced by the ancillary statements of the Tosephta. said, they discussed the recitation of , ( 6:7) “you should talk about them.” Rebbi Judah ben Pazi said, they were discussing Creation, ( 33:6) “through the word of the Eternal the heavens were made.” Rebbi Yudan, the son of Rebbi Ayvu in the third generation of Amoraïm. He learned from all Galilean Amoraïm of the second generation. His son Rebbi Yudan might be the Rebbi Yudan who otherwise is quoted without mention of his father’s name., said, they were occupied with the consolations of Jerusalem, as you say ( 40:2) “Speak to Jerusalem’s heart.” But the rabbis say, they were occupied with the Divine Chariot, as you say ( 2:11) “behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire, etc.” Rav Jeremiah said, one should start to pray only from a practical rule and is considered a contrast to, not an explanation of, the requirement of the Mishnah that one pray only in a serious frame of mind. In the Yerushalmi it is considered to be the genuine interpretation of the Mishnah. דין של הלכה means a practical ruling that is well established, that gives no cause for discussion which could interfere with the concentration needed for prayer. The Babli and the personalities whose practices in preparation of prayer are reported are so early that the name here must be Rav Jeremiah and not Rebbi Jeremiah.. Rav Jeremiah said, he who deals with public needs is like him who studies Torah. Rav Ḥuna said: a woman who saw a spot like a mustard seed sits and watches seven days of purification because of it; then he stood up and prayed. Zeïra bar Ḥinena said: He who draws blood from a dedicated animal committed larceny; that is one of the decided practices. Bar Qappara stated: Eleven days between periods is a practice taught to Moses at Sinai. Rebbi Hoshaiah stated: One may add produce on the stalk and be tricky in order to free it from tithes and tithes after the harvest, when it is separated from the stalk and collected in heaps or silos. By a rabbinic ordinance, it is forbidden to eat grain on the stalk as a meal, once it has been transported from the field to the farmhouse or barn. However, eating it as snack from the grain on the stalk is still permitted. Now Rebbi Hoshaiah approves of setting aside as much of the produce for animal feed as one desires, without incurring an obligation for and tithes. This is also quoted as beyond doubt in Babli 31a.. Abdan asked Rebbi: How many levels or sacrificial meat, these become “third in impurity”. Sacrifial meat only can become “fourth in impurity” which will make it unusable either for the altar or for consumption by Cohanim. (Mishnah 2:3, 2:1). The additional levels of impurity are a rabbinic institution, not subject to discussion. are there for dedicated things? He answered him: four. And how many levels for ? He answered: three, then he stood up and prayed. Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: The following verse should never leave your lips: ( 46:12) “The Eternal of hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is a refuge to us, Selah”. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abin, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan and the colleagues: ( 84:13) “O Eternal of hosts, hail to the man who trusts in You”. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: May it be please You, o Eternal, our God and God of our fathers, that You may save us from agressive, hard, evil hours that organize to come upon the world 16b).. “One starts to pray only in a serious frame of mind.” Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, ( 29:2) “Bow down before the Eternal in the splendor of the sanctuary,” in fear of the holy. Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said, ( 2:11) “Serve the Eternal in fear, rejoice in trembling.” Rebbi Aḥa said, when an evil day should come, you may rejoice 31a, s. v. במקום), R. Aḥa gives the simple sense of the verse, in contrast to the homiletics of R. Yose ben R. Ḥanina.. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, he who is about to pray has to sit down twice. Once before he prays and once after he prays. Before he prays, ( 84:5) “Hail to those who sit in Your house.” Once after he prays, ( 140:14) “But the righteous will thank Your name, the upright ones will sit before You.” “The first waited one hour before praying,” they prayed for one hour and waited an hour after their prayer. When did they study Torah? When did they work? Rebbi Isaac ben Rebbi Eleazar in the Babli (32b); this may indicate that the author here is the earlier of two Amoraïm of that name, a student of R. Yoḥanan. The Babli, which notes explicitly that the pious were spending 9 hours in prayer, must take “an hour” in its exact sense; the Yerushalmi may accept “an hour” as “some time”. On the other hand, the replacement of “sitting down” by “waiting” may indicate that in this paragraph ישב has its original Biblical meaning of “being occupied, being at one’s regular place of business.” said, because they were pious, their study was blessed and their work was blessed. Ḥuna said, he who prays behind the synagogue is called criminal as it is said ( 12:9) “Criminals walk around.” Rav Ḥuna the parallel statement is one of R. Joshua ben Levi, the author of the preceding homiletics, and is part of his homiletics on 84:5. said, one who does not enter a synagogue in this world will not enter the synagogue in the future world. What is the reason? ( 12:9) “Criminals walk around.” Rebbi Yoḥanan said: He who prays in his own house is as if he were surrounded by an iron wall. The argument of Rebbi Yoḥanan is inverted. There Rebbi Abba said, Rebbi Ḥiyya said in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan, one has to pray at a place that is dedicated to prayer. And here he says that? One is about a single person, the other about the public. Rebbi Phineas in the name of Rebbi Hoshaiah: He who prays in the synagogue is as if he had sacrificed a pure flour offering. What is the reason? ( 66:20) “As the children of Israel bring flour offering in a pure vessel in the Eternal’s House.” Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: ( 55:6) “Seek the Eternal where He is to be found”. Where is He to be found? In synagogues and houses of study. “Call on Him when He is close.” Where is He close? In synagogues and houses of study. Rebbi Isaac ben Rebbi Eleazar said, not only that but their God stands over them. What is the reason? ( 82:1) “God stands in the assembly of the mighty; from the inside God will judge.” Rav Ḥisda said: He who enters the synagogue must enter inside two doors. What is the reason ( 8:34) “Hail to the man who listens to Me, always to be diligent at My doors.” My doors and not my door. Doorposts and not doorpost. If he did that, what is written there? ( 8:35) “Because he who found Me found life.” Rav Ḥuna said: He who goes to the synagogue must be light-footed. What is the reason? ( 6:3) “We shall know, let us run to know the Eternal.” But when one leaves, one has to go in small steps. What is the reason? ( 14:16) “For now You will count my steps.” Rebbi Yoḥanan said: A covenant is sealed that he who labors at his studies in the synagogue will not quickly forget. Rebbi Ḥanina from Ein Tana said: A covenant is sealed that he who labors at his studies in modesty will not quickly forget. What is the reason? ( 11:2) “Wisdom is with the modest.” Rebbi Yoḥanan said: A covenant is sealed that he who studies homiletics from a book will not quickly forget. Rebbi Tanḥum said: He who understands what he has learned will not quickly forget. What is the reason? ( 4:9) “That you shall not forget the things your eyes understood. 16:1) that homiletics is a part of “oral Torah” that may not be written down. Next comes the statement of R. Ḥanina of Ein Tana, Amora of the fourth generation and student of R. Zeïra. (His name is corrupted in the Venice print to R. Yoḥanan of Ein Tana; it is correct in the Rome ms. Ein Tana was a place near Sepphoris.) At the end comes the statement of the fifth generation Rebbi Tanḥum (Tanḥuma bar Abba, the first known author of a collection of and greatest of the preachers of the period of the Talmud Yerushalmi).” Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Tanḥum ben Rebbi Ḥiyya, He who sees a disquieting dream must say: “May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that all my dreams that I dreamed, in this night or in any other night, whether I dreamed or others dreamed about me, if they are good they should be fulfilled for me in enjoyment and joy, blessing and life. If they are something else then, just as You turned bitter water to sweet waters, the waters of Jericho to sweet ones through Elisha, and the curse of the son of Beör to a blessing, so may You turn all bad dreams, including what others dreamed about me, to good, blessing, healing, life, joy and enjoyment, and peace. ( 30:12–13) ‘You turned my wailing into a dance, you opened my sackcloth and girded me with joy. So that the liver may sing to You and never be silent; o Eternal, my God, I shall eternally thank You! ( 23:6) The Eternal, your God, refused to listen to Bileam, the Eternal, your God, turned curse into blessing since the Eternal, your God, loves you. ( 31:12) Then the maiden will rejoice in dance, young and old men together; I shall turn their mourning to enjoyment and I shall console them and give them joy out of their hurt.’ ” “Even if the king greets one, he should not respond.” Rebbi Aḥa said, that is, if the greeter is a king of Israel. But one returns greeting from a Gentile king. It was stated3:22, 5:6.: If one is writing a Divine name, then even if the king greets him, he should not respond. If he is writing two or three Names, e. g. ( 22:22) “Powerful, God, Eternal”, he finishes one of them and then responds to the greeting. Rebbi Yoḥanan when the ἄρχων, the prefect of the district, passed by. He was in danger to be beaten up by prefect’s bodygard but, as ruler of a city with an important Jewish population, he was acquainted with their behavior and their adherence to the νόμος, “the law” of the Torah. was sitting and reciting in front of the Babylonian synagogue of Sepphoris. The prefect passed by and he did not get up before him. They wanted to whip him; he said to them: Let him, he is occupied in the laws of his Creator. Rebbi Ḥanina and Rebbi Joshua ben Levi appeared before the proconsul of Caesarea. He saw them and rose before them. They said to him, you get up before these Jews? He said to them, I saw faces of angels. Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Jose appeared before Ursicinus in Antiochia. He saw them and rose before them. They said to him, you get up before these Jews? He said, I win in battle if I see the faces of these. Rebbi Abun appeared before the king 106a, “when Rabin came, it was because he was in danger of being killed.”. When he left, he turned his neck. They came and wanted to kill him but they saw two sparks of fire emanating from his neck, so they let him go, to affirm what is said ( 28:10): “All peoples of the earth will see that the Name of the Eternal is called over you and they will be afraid of you. on the head. It can be safely assumed that this statement of an Israeli Tanna was known to the editors of the Yerushalmi, so they had no need for an explicit statement that the sparks came from the straps of R. Abun’s .” Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai stated: “All peoples of the earth will see that the name of the Eternal is called over you”, all - even spirits and demons. Rebbi Yannai and Rebbi Jonathan were promenading in a forest, “forest”. The Rome ms. reading is אסרטין, Latin , “street”, Genizah fragments read אסטדין “stadion.” The forest is a more likely place to find promenading rabbis greeted by a demon.. One saw them, greeted them, and said: “Peace upon you, rabbis.” They said, even the religious title does not harm us. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish was thinking very hard about Torah. He overstepped the Sabbath boundary without noticing it, to confirm ( 5:19): “In its love you will always err.” Rebbi Yudan ben Rebbi Ismael was thinking very hard about Torah. His toga slipped off from him and he did not notice it, to confirm: “In its love you will always err.” Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon was thinking very hard about Torah. His toga slipped off from him but a viper was caring for it. His students told him: Teacher, your toga has slipped off. He said to them, does this evil one not care for it? “Even if a snake is wound around one’s heel, one should not interrupt.” Rebbi Ḥuna in the name of Rebbi Yose: They mentioned only a snake, but for a scorpion he interrupts. Why, because it stings repeatedly. Rebbi Ilaï said: They stated only “wound around”, but if a snake is attacking him, he hides before him but he should not interrupt his prayer. It is stated: If he was praying in a thoroughfare or on a square he removes himself from before a donkey or before a cart but he should not interrupt his prayer. They said about Rebbi Ḥanina ben Dosa 3:30; a very different version is in Babli 33a. that he was standing in prayer when a brightly dotted snake 16:4); in Arabic the parallel root is חבר “to be richly ornamented” [distinguished from Hebrew חבר, Arabic ח̇בר, “to be joined”.] The word could also denote a brightly striped snake. The more brightly a snake is colored, the more poisonous it is. came and bit him. He did not interrupt his prayer. They went and found that dotted snake lying dead at the entrance of its hole. They said, woe to the human who is bitten by a dotted snake, but woe to the dotted snake that bites Rebbi Ḥanina ben Dosa. [What is the nature of that dotted snake? If it bites a human and the human reaches water first, the dotted snake dies, but if the dotted snake reaches water first, the human dies.] His students asked him: Rabbi, did you not notice? He said to them: There should happen to me these things; I was concentrating on my prayer and did not notice! Rebbi Isaac ben Eleazar tradition. said, the Holy One, praise to Him, created a well under his foot soles, to confirm what has been said ( 145: 19): “He will do the will of those who fear Him, He will hear their entreaties and save them.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: One mentions the power of rains in “resurrection of the dead. The benediction “for years” is the ninth, a prayer for a plentiful harvest. is the required declaration of a “difference” between Sabbath (or holiday) and weekday, after the end of the Sabbath or holiday. No work may be performed before some form of . The benediction for being granted knowledge is the fourth, the one for thanksgiving the 17th.”; one prays for rain in the benediction “of years” and in “He Who by His grace grants knowledge;” Rebbi Aqiba said: it is recited as separate fourth benediction; Rebbi Eliezer says, in “thanksgiving”. HALAKHAH: Just as the resurrection of the dead brings life to the world, so rains bring life to the world. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba understood it from here ( 6:2–3): “He will resurrect us after two days, on the third day He will raise us up and we shall live before Him. We shall know, we shall pursue to know the Eternal, like morning his appearance is well-based 1:1 (fol. 63d), 11:8 (fol. 30c), Babli 31a, 97a..” It is written ( 17:1) “Elijah the Tisbite, from the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Aḥab: By the Living Eternal One, the God of Israel, before Whom I stood, there will not be dew nor rain these years except by my word.” Rebbi Berekhia said, Rebbi Yasa and the rabbis. One of them said, he was heard both for dew and for rain; the other one said, he was heard for rain but was not heard for dew, from ( 18:1): “Go, appear before Aḥab and I shall give rain 1:1, is included to explain the connection of the (summer) praise for dew in the benediction on “resurrection”. The praise for dew was included in the Yerushalmi prayer rite., etc.” And he who said, he was heard both for dew and for rain, where was the vow of dew dissolved? Rebbi Tanḥuma from Edreï). Since he appears together with Rebbi Berekhiah, he must belong to the last generation of Amoraïm in Israel. It is the minority opinion of Rebbi Aqiba ( 9:6) that if in an earthly court part of a vow is annulled because it was executed under false intent, then the entire vow is annulled. This is not the majority opinion, hence, it is not the practice and does not imply Heavenly standards. said, they are of the opinion that a vow that was dissolved partially is dissolved totally. Some want to say, on the occasion of the son of the woman from Sarepta, ( 17:20) “He called on the Eternal and said, o Eternal, my God, etc.” Rebbi Judah ben Pazi said, about one who stole a doctor’s bag), word also used for “casket for unguents”, and title of medical works. Hesiod has Prometheus carry off the fire in the stalk of a νάρθηξ.. When he left, his son was injured.He returned to him and said: Please, sir doctor, heal my son. He said to him: Go and return my bag because it is full of medicines, and I shall heal your son. So the Holy One, praise to Him, said to Elijah: Go and lift the vow of dew because the dead are resurrected only by dew, then I shall resurrect the son of the Sareptan. And from where that the dead will live only by dew? ( 26:19) “Your dead will live, the corpses will arise. Wake up and jubilate, those who dwell in dust! For a dew of light is Your dew, וְאֶרֶץ רְפָאִים תַּפִּיל.” Rebbi Tanḥum from Edreï said, “the earth will give up those that are deposited in it.” Rebbi Jacob from Kefar Ḥanan in the name of Resh Laqish: When Abraham their forefather did My will, I swore to him that dew will never move away from his descendants forever; what is the reason? ( 110:3) “You have the dew of your youth.” And it is written after that ( 110:4) “The Eternal swore and He will not change His intention.” Rebbi Judah ben Pazi said, by a will I gave it to Abraham, as a gift I gave it to him. (Gen. 27:28) “God may give you from the dew of heaven.” Rebbi Samuel ben Naḥmani said, when Israel sin and do evil the rains are arrested. They bring an old man like Rebbi Yose the Galilean, he prays for them and the rains come. But dew does not descend by the merit of any creature, what is the reason? ( 5:6) “Like dew from the Eternal, like light showers on grass, that do not listen to anybody nor wait for humans.” Rebbi Zeïra in the name if Rebbi Ḥanina: When someone stood [praying] in the rainy season and mentioned dew one does not make him repeat. In the season of dew and he mentioned rain one makes him repeat. But is it not stated will be repeated before the discussion turns to it. The statement of Rebbi Ḥanina and the discussion of its last part is quoted in Alfassi 1:1 where it is added to the tradition of the same Rebbi Ḥanina in the Babylonian Talmud ( 3b): “In summertime, one who says ‘He Who makes the wind blow’ does not have to repeat; if he says ‘He Who makes rain descend,’ he has to repeat. In wintertime, one who omits ‘He Who makes the wind blow’ does not have to repeat; if he omits ‘He Who makes rain descend,’ he has to repeat.” Alfassi gives no interpretation of the Yerushalmi he quotes but the early Medieval authorities R. Zeraḥia Halevi, R. Abraham ben David, Nachmanides, and R. Nissim Gerondi all have different interpretations (mutually contradictory) and most of them also have different readings. Among manuscripts, the expression דְּלָא מַצְלִי וְלָא מֵיקַל appears with or without one or both לָא. The following interpretation follows Nachmanides closely. [Most commentaries agree with R. Nissim Gerondi in taking מיקל as a form of a contracted form of קלל “to curse”; such a form קול is nowhere attested, but קיל “to take, make easy” is frequent.]: The sages did not oblige one to mention dew and winds but if he wants to mention them, he may mention? One cannot compare one who takes it easy to one who does not pray and does not take it easy. “When he stood in the rainy season and mentioned dew one does not make him repeat.” But is it not stated: If he did not ask for it in the benediction “for years”, or he did not mention the power of rains in “resurrection of the dead”, one makes him repeat? That is about one who mentioned neither dew nor rain. Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rebbi Ḥuna: If he did not ask in the benediction “for years” he says it in “He Who hears prayer”. Similarly, if he did not mention the power of rains in “resurrection of the dead” he says it in “He Who hears prayer”. If the request, made under duress, may be recited in “He Who hears prayer,” the mention, made under easy circumstances, so much more! But is it not stated: If he did not ask in the benediction “for years” or that he did not mention the power of rains in “resurrection of the dead”, one makes him repeat 29a, has the statement formulated here in the name of Rav Assi from the Yeshivah of Rav in Babylonia; the Babli mentions neither the statement of Rebbi Ḥuna nor the explanation of Rebbi Eudaimon.]? Rebbi Eudaimon the brother of Rebbi Yose said, if he did not say it in “He Who hears prayer”! Where does he return to.? Just as Rebbi Simeon bar Abba said in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: On the day of the New Moon, if he had moved his feet it is forbidden to move one’s feet since the angels do not move their feet. Hence, moving after prayer is the outward sign that prayer is finished. he repeats from the start, otherwise from “Temple service”. Here also, if he had moved his feet he repeats from the start. At Nineveh 2:1. (Eusebius mentions that the Jews call it Nineveh.) On the Golan plain, one needs spring rains if the winter was relatively dry. they needed to make a fast-day after Passover 1:1; the question and the answer, without the discussion, are mentioned succinctly in Babli 14b.. They came to ask Rebbi. He told them, go ahead and make one but do not change the form of prayer.. Where may he say it? Rebbi Jeremiah thought to say that he says it in “He Who hears prayer.” Rebbi Yose said to him: Did not Rebbi Zeïra say in the name of Rebbi Ḥuna: If he did notask in the benediction “for years”, or that he failed to mention the power of rains in “resurrection of the dead”, one makes him repeat at “He Who hears prayer the text is easier to understand; there it says “he says” instead of “one makes him repeat”; meaning that a prayer for rain at “He Who hears prayer” belongs to the regular form of prayer in winter and, therefore, by Rebbi’s statement is excluded from summer prayer.?” But Rebbi said to them, go ahead and make one but do not change the form of prayer! According to the opinion of Rebbi Yose, where does one say it? In the six that he adds. Rebbi Yose must imply that even a local fast for rain is a public fast.. That works for the public which has six. A private person who does not have six, where? Rebbi Ḥanina said, did not Rebbi Zeïra say in the name of Rav Ḥuna, a private person asks for his personal needs in “He Who hears prayer,” and these are his needs. “And in ‘He Who by His grace grants knowledge’ ”. Simeon bar Abba asked before Rebbi Yoḥanan: Something that one does all the time, and the Sages differ about it? He said to him: Since its main place is over a cup they forgot it in prayer and , why does one not check and see what they instituted? He answered him: Originally, they instituted in prayer. When they got rich, they instituted it over a cup of wine. When they became poor again, they went back and instituted it back in prayer.” This implies that the differences of opinion expressed in the Mishnah refer to the second institution of prayer and that the order of the first institution therefore is irrelevant. In the Yerushalmi, the question is, how can there arise a difference of usage in something that every Jew has been doing every week since the times of the Great Assembly? The answer also here is that there was a time where only over a cup of wine was practiced.. His statement means that its main place is over a cup over a cup was not disestablished, the mention in prayer is additional.. Rebbi Jacob bar Idi in the name of the old Rebbi Isaac: If he said it over a cup he must repeat it in prayer; it was was said over the cup only to teach children. in order to let children participate. His statement means that its main place is in prayer. Rebbi Zeïra, Rav Yehudah in the name of Samuel: If he said it over a cup he must repeat it in prayer, if he said it in prayer he must repeat it over a cup. His statement means that its main place is here as well as there. “Rebbi Eliezer says, in ‘thanksgiving’ ”. Rebbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rebbi: One is inclined toward Rebbi Eliezer’s opinion on a holiday that falls immediately after the Sabbath for the holiday. The last two statements are quoted in Babli 8a.. The old Rebbi Isaac in the name of Rebbi: Practice follows Rebbi Eliezer on a holiday that falls after the Sabbath. Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel: Practice follows Rebbi Eliezer at all times. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: Practice follows Rebbi Eliezer at all times. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, not because because there are two traditions, but because Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman and Rebbi Eleazar both say in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel: Practice follows Rebbi Eliezer at all times. “And in “He Who in His grace grants knowledge”, the words of the Sages. Rebbi Aqibah said: one says it as separate fourth benediction has to be recited according to Rebbi Aqiba, even though his way of doing it is not accepted as practice. Hence, the discussion in this paragraph is purely theoretical.” Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Samuel: He says it as fourth benediction. Rebbi Yudan says, the text of the benediction and after that he says . His version agrees with Rebbi presupposes knowledge, it was incorporated in the benediction for knowledge.”], since Rebbi said: I wonder why they eliminated “He Who in His grace grants knowledge” on Sabbath; if there is no knowledge, where is prayer? And here, if there is no knowledge, where is ? Rebbi Isaac ben Eleazar said, he says and afterwards adds the text of the benediction. Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Hoshaiah 103b–104a) in the name of Rebbi Oshaya (Babylonian form of Hoshaiah). The entire paragraph has the appearance of being written by a person unable to pronounce an “h”.: Only one should not mention less than three separations. Rebbi Yoḥanan said, they said that he who says little should not say less than three and he who adds should not add more than seven separations. Levi said, but only separations mentioned in the Torah 10:10), between light and darkness ( 1:4), between Israel and the Gentiles ( 20:26). There are no more than seven separations mentioned in the Torah. [The other four are between upper and lower waters, between day and night, between pure and impure, between Levites and other Israelites.]. Naḥum ben Rebbi Simai went out and said in his father’s name: even one separation. But Rebbi Abbahu said, one must seal with “separation”. Rebbi Mana objected, even if he started by “He Who separates between holy and worldly” and ends, seals by “He Who separates between holy and worldly”? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, is it not from the benedictions that one starts with “praised” and ends with “praised” 104a) there is a discussion whether the separation referred to in the concluding benediction is the first or the last one of the list. In any case, it is clear that R. Abbahu cannot agree with R. Naḥum bar Simai to produce the meaningless formula of R. Mana. Hence, the opinion of R. Naḥum must be rejected.? Rebbi Eleazar ben Antigonos in the name of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yannai 150b), the statement is in the name of Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob, one of the last students of Rebbi Aqiba and a major authority. In the Babli, the statement is relativized to mean that one does not even have to pray but just to recite “Praise to Him Who separates between holy and wordly” to be able to do any work. There is no such relativization in the Yerushalmi; however, it is implied by the next paragraph.: That means has to be inserted in the first weekday benediction of the . Hence, it is the first thing that one has to do. The argument in this paragraph takes this up: Since it was ordained that precedes the weekday prayer with its supplications for wordly needs, it also must precede worldly deeds. [The first weekday benediction also contains a supplication but, as Rebbi is quoted in an earlier paragraph, a prayer for knowledge is acceptable also for the Sabbath.] that one is forbidden from doing any work before one recites . As he said, he said that one is forbidden from doing any work before one recites , and similarly one is forbidden to pray for one’s needs before one recites . Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Eleazar ben Antigonos in the name of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yannai in the name of the important Rebbi Yehudah 106a), R. Zeïra is quoted as permitting the recitation of only until Wednesday afternoon.: If he did not recite at the end of Sabbath, he recites even on Thursday. That is restricted to proper, but “illuminating fire” he may say only immediately 12b (8:6), Babli 54a). Hence, it makes no sense to recite the benediction at any other time. The rule proclaimed here is attributed in the Babli ( 54a) to R. Jacob ben Idi.. Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Yehudah, Rebbi Abba in the name of Abba bar Jeremiah: Even if a holiday falls in the middle of the week onerecites “He Who separates between Sabbath and the six workdays before the final doxology. That “separation” is not in the Torah and not in the list of 3 - 7 separations, but necessitated by the circumstances. The statement really means that the text of for holidays is identical with that for the Sabbath. In the Babli ( 26b) the statement is attributed to R. Zeïra only, without discussion.” Rebbi Zeïra said to Rav Yehudah: Has one six workdays before him? He said to him: Has one impurity and purity before him? Rebbi Jeremiah, Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi: One must say, “start the days, the six coming workdays. Sephardic and Oriental rites do not have the phrase., for peace.” Rebbi Abba adds: “And let us hear in them rejoicing and joy.” Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah: “Let us understand and teach us.” Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah: Those who answer Amen over a cup, they must see what he is doing. have to look at the cup and the candle. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah 35b, it is stated that no obligation connected with things that grow can be executed other than using them in the way they grew (bottom down, head up). [In the Babli, “Ḥizqiah” should be “Rebbi Ḥizqiah” since “Ḥizqiah” without title refers to the son of Rebbi Ḥiyya, older than Rebbi Zeïra.]: The four kinds of the must be taken in the direction of their growth.",

G.).}! Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Simeon: He is like one who makes finite the measures of the Holy One, praise to Him: Your mercies reach down to the bird’s nest. Some Tannaïm formulate “over”, some Tannaïm formulate “to”. He who says “over” supports Rebbi Phineas, he who says “to” supports Rebbi Yose. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said 33b, 25a), the statement is attributed either to R. Yose bar Abun or to R. Yose bar Zabida.: They do not act well who declare the measures of the Holy One, praise to Him, to be mercy. And those 22:28, with minor changes. who translate ( 22:21) “My people Israel, just as I am merciful in Heaven so you should be merciful on earth. A cow or a mother sheep, it and its young you should not slaughter together on one day,” they do not act well because they declare the measures of the Holy One, praise to Him, to be mercy. “One silences one who says ‘we thank, we thank.’” Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said ( 63:12): “For the mouth of those who speak lies will be dammed up.) it is explained that the one who says so, like the one who wants to mention God’s name only on good things, gives the impression that there are two independent forces, God for the good and Satan–Ahriman for the bad. The Babli objects to the opinion expressed here that any repetition of sections of prayer texts is permitted in private for emphasis.” That is, in public. But in private it is supplication. “If the one standing before the arc makes a mistake.” Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina in the name of Rebbi Ḥananiah ben Gamliel: If one erred in one of the first three benedictions, he starts anew. Each one of these groups has the status of a single benediction in this respect.. Ada bar bar Ḥana, Ganiva in the name of Rav: If one erred in one of the last three benedictions, he returns to “Temple Service.” Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rav Huna in the name of Rav in Halakhah 2:4.: If one erred in one of the first three benedictions, he starts anew; in one of the last three benedictions, he returns to “Temple Service”; if he erred and he cannot remember where he erred he returns to the place that is clear to him. Rebbi Aḥa and Rebbi Judah ben Pazy were sitting in a synagogue. One came and stood before the arc and forgot one benediction. They went and asked Rebbi Simon. Rebbi Simon said to them in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: One does not remove an emissary of the congregation who forgot two or three benedictions. They found a formulation that made a difference: One does not remove him for anything except if he did not say “He Who revives the dead”, “He Who subdues evildoers”, “He Who builds Jerusalem;” I say that he is a sectarian. Samuel Minor stood before the ark and forgot “He Who subdues evildoers.” At the end he started looking at them. They said to him, the Sages did not take you as a yardstick. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: If one is in doubt whether he mentioned the New Moon or not, one makes him repeat. Where does he return to? Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan, if he had moved his feet, he repeats from the start, otherwise from “Temple Service.” Rebbi Judah ben Pazi said, if he let his thoughts wander that is as if he had moved his feet. The private supplications, as exemplified in the texts presented in Halakhah 4:2. They are certainly part of prayer and recited while standing still, but not part of official prayers. Hence, their status in respect to repetition is unclear. are a problem. Rebbi Abba the son of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan. The main place of this paragraph is in Halakhah 4:5.: If one became paralyzed while reading in the Torah, the one who steps in for him should start from the place the first one started. For if you say from the place he stopped, the first verses would have been blessed before them but not after them, the last ones after them but not before them, but it is written ( 19:8): “The Torah of the Eternal is perfect, restores the soul”, that it should be totally perfect. It has been stated 3:20. The parallel to this discussion is found in Yerushalmi 4:1. The Babli ( 27a) quotes only the result of the present discussion.: Two should not read the Torah and one translate, translated the verse into Aramaic (Onkelos for Eastern, Yerushalmi for Western congregations). In Greek speaking congregations, the Greek text (Septuagint, later Aquila, Symmachos, or Theodotion) was used.. Rebbi Zeïra said, because of the benedictions. But has it not been stated: Two should not translate and one read; could you say that is because of the benedictions? But it is because two voices do not enter into one ear. It has been stated: “Two may read in the Torah but two may not read the in the prophets.” Rebbi Ulla said, one calls several people to the Torah does not speak of simultaneous, but of successive readers. It asserts that the after the Torah reading on Sabbaths, holidays, and fastdays, cannot be split between different readers, but the Torah reading should be split among different people for different sections. but one does not call several people for the prophets. Rebbi Joshua the Southerner said: There are three things of which too little or too much is bad and average is good: sour dough, salt, and refusal. The first time he refuses, the second time he hesitates, the third time he runs and comes. Rebbi Ḥuna was sitting in a synagogue. The organizer came and importuned one to go up and he did not accept it. At the end, that one came to Rebbi Eleazar and said to him: My master should not be angry with me; I did not go up because I was not fully awake. He said to him: I am not mad at you but at the one who importuned. Batitay was paralized at the recitiation of 6:3 and 3:12 in the middle of the first benediction of . [The paragraph cannot deal with in the since there are not mentioned in the introductory sentence and any error in the first three benedictions requires restarting anyhow.] Rebbi Abun’s answer shows that Baṭiṭai the reader was paralyzed not during, but after his recitation of the sentence connecting 6:3 and 3:12 since the congregation already had answered the second verse. The first part of the benediction speaks of the creation of the world and leads up to the second part after is a hymn to God in His relation to man; it has a different subject. The Yerushalmi here assumes that the before the could not be recited in private prayers. Hence, the two parts of the benediction, both of which can be recited in private prayer, in public service have the status of two distinct benedictions in the sense of the Mishnah.. They went and asked Rebbi Abun. Rebbi Abun said to them in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: His replacement should start at the place where he interrupted. They said to him: But did we not state: “He starts from the start of the benediction where the other person made the error?” He said to them: Since you answered it is as if you started a new benediction.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who stands before the arc should not answer Amen after the Cohanim because of the distraction. If there is no Cohen there but him, he should not lift his hands. But if he is sure that he can lift his hands and return to his prayer, he may do so 7(1), an early Israeli Midrash, extends the last sentence, “but if he is sure that he can return to his prayer, he may do so,” also to answering Amen after the Cohanim, “because there is nothing greater before the Holy One, praise to Him, than the Amen which Israel answer.” It is very likely that when this Midrash was composed, the flowering of synagogal poetry already had led to the writing of prayer books for the reader.. HALAKHAH: It was stated 3:27 is similar to this text.: He who recites the blessings for the to 9:13 where הוא יברך הזבח is rendered by הוּא פָרִיס מְזוֹנָא. The Gaonic interpretation is that, even though at the end of a full prayer one may recite Amen on his own prayer, this does not apply to the benedictions after the . Most Medieval commentators take פורס to mean “to parcel out” and apply the term to a group of people who prayed with less than a quorum and after the found themselves with 10 adult males; they then may appoint a reader who recites half ברכוּ, possibly the first benediction for the , and the repetition of the with and the priestly blessings. The Ashkenazic interpretation is supported by the reading of the Tosephta () where פורס clearly means “breaking, parcel out”., he who stands before the ark, he who lifts his hands, he who reads in the Torah, he who recites from the prophets, and he who recites any blessing for obligations spelled out in the Torah, should not recite Amen after his own benediction. If he answered, he is uncivilized. Some Tannaïm have stated: he is uncivilized; and some Tannaïm have stated: he is wise. Rav Ḥisda said: He who said “he is wise” refers to him who answers at the end). This is the reasonable interpretation of the Yerushalmi here. In the Babli, the parallel discussion is 45b on reciting Grace after the meal, where Amen separates the part which is a Biblical obligation from the rest which is purely rabbinic. Hence, Ashkenazic interpretation restricts “Amen” after one’s own benediction to the third benediction of Grace., but he who says “he is uncivilized” refers to him who answers every single benediction. Rebbi Ḥanina said 37a.: Two Israel and one Cohen, one takes the Cohen in the middle. That is, when they are all equal. But if one of them is learned, one takes the one with a title #577. in the middle. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said: I never recited Grace 28a, that is rather vehemently opposed by R. Yoḥanan. in the presence of a Cohen and I never let an Israel say Grace before me 5:9, the reading is “before him”, meaning the Cohen. In that version, R. Joshua ben Levi negates the entire ruling of R. Ḥanina and states that the Cohen always has precedence. Nevertheless, since his statement is formulated as a personal act, not as a precept for everybody, the Yerushalmi proves by this statement that the precedence given the Cohen is a Rabbinic ordinance, not a Torah law. [R. Eliahu Fulda and R. Z. Frankel hold that R. Joshua was a Levite and extends the rule of R. Ḥanina to place the Levite between Cohen and Israel in order of precedence.]. Rebbi Judah ben Pazi in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: Every Cohen who stays in the synagogue and does not lift his hands transgresses a positive commandment 38b) three positive commandments are enumerated that the Cohen transgresses by his inaction.]. When Rebbi Judah ben Pazi was weak he supported his head and stood behind a pillar. Rebbi Eleazar went outside. Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Tanḥuma ben Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Simlai: They lift their hands in a town where all are Cohanim 38b) it is required that 10 Cohanim remain in their places in order to answer Amen after the blessings. The Babli is everywhere opposed to giving women a place in services or study. From here to the end of the Halakhah, the text is found (almost) word by word in Yerushalmi 5:9.. Whom do they bless? Their brethren in North, South, East, and West. Who answers Amen after them? Women and small children. Abbaye ben Rebbi Benjamin 38b) he is called Abba the son of Rav Minyamin bar Ḥiyya, a Babylonian Amora of the third generation. stated: Those who stand behind the Cohanim are not included in their blessing. Those who stand before the Cohanim; Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said the blessing even cuts through an iron wall) this is a tradition of R. Joshua ben Levi.. About those who stand on the side, we may understand from the following 12:2, dealing with a man who wants to sprinkle from the water mixed with ashes from the red heifer on a person impure by contact with a dead body. It is a general rule that the water used for this purpose becomes invalid if, after it was taken from a flowing source, the person in charge of the water lets it slip from his mind. An action that contradicts the intention has the status of a slip of mind.: If he wanted to sprinkle before him and he sprinkled behind him, behind him and he sprinkled before him, his sprinkling is invalid. Before him and he sprinkled on his sides, his sprinkling is valid. This implies that those who stand on the side are included in the blessing). Rav Ḥisda said, the organizer must be an Israel 38a), Rav Ḥisda is quoted to the opposite effect that only a Cohen may call “Cohanim”. However, in one manuscript (Rome) of the Babli, the reading is not “a Cohen may call ‘Cohanim’ ” but “one Cohen calls ‘Cohanim’ ” and then the statement would be parallel to the Yerushalmi. This reading of the Babli is the basis of the interpretation of (the Italian) .. Rav Naḥman bar Jacob said, if there was one Cohen he calls “Cohen”), Abbaye declares that one Cohen is not called at all but he starts by himself., if there are two they call “Cohanim”. Rav Ḥisda, the author of this statement is Rav Ḥuna. said, even if there was only one Cohen he says “Cohanim”, because he only calls the tribe.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Which benedictions are recited on produce? On tree-grown fruits one says “Creator of the fruit of the tree” except for wine, because on wine one says “Creator of the fruit of the vine.” But on fruits of the land one says “Creator of the fruit of the soil” except for bread, because on bread one says “He Who produces bread from the earth.” On vegetables one says “Creator of the fruit of the soil”, Rebbi Yehudah says: “Creator of kinds of vegetables.” HALAKHAH: It is written ( 24:1): “The Eternal’s are the earth and what is in it, the dry land and its inhabitants.” He who profits from the world commits larceny until good deeds will permit him 8:10. The obligation to recite blessings before one eats is not mentioned explicitly in the Torah. Since Grace is only treated in the next Chapter, one has to find here Biblical allusions to this duty and (in the next section) to the duty of reciting a benediction before fulfilling specified commandments. The verse appears in the Babli (35a) in the name of Samuel. R. Levi compares the verse ( 115:16) “Heaven is the Eternal’s heaven but the earth He gave to mankind”, explaining that before a benediction everything is the Eternal’s property but after a benediction it becomes human property. While Rebbi Levi is a Galilean teacher, the Yerushalmi rejects his combination since in the third paragraph earthly enjoyment is only “ if one ate from one’s own”. The text of the Yerushalmi is from Tosephta 4:1 which is identical with the Talmudic text except that there it says “until all good deeds will permit him”, meaning that only if the preparation of food is completely within the commandments of the Torah then the last step of the preparation, the recitation of the benediction, will allow the food to be given to man as his own.. Rebbi Abbahu said, it is written ( 22:9) “Lest the fullness of the seed that you sow and the yield of the vineyard should be forbidden.” The entire world and its contents are like a vineyard. What is its redemption? The benediction 27:11). However, there can be no monetary redemption of anything not explicitly authorized in the Torah. Hence, the redemption is non-monetary and is the traditional praise given to God in benedictions. [The simple sense of the verse is that produce grown in a vineyard becomes forbidden for private use as if it were dedicated for sacrifice.]. Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: ( 16:2) “Say to the Eternal, You are my Master, my good is only with You.” If you ate and recited the benedictions then it is as if you ate from your own. Another explanation 19:24) or, more frequently, “mixed with fluid, moistened.”: “My good is בל with you”, I am feeding My goodness to your body. Another explanation: “My good is בל with you”, all good things may be mixed together and come to you. Rebbi Aḥa said, what is “only with you?” I shall not bring any good things to the world without you. As it is said ( 41:44) “Without you nobody may lift his hand.” Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: ( 19:24) “Holy for praises”, this shows that it needs benediction before and after. From here did Rebbi Aqiba say that nobody should taste anything before he gives praise on the verse. The verse speaks of the fruits of a vineyard in its fourth year when the grapes can be used for the first time after having been forbidden for the first three years. This is only a hint for any other food.. Rebbi Ḥaggai and Rebbi Jeremiah went to the Bazaar even though it is difficult to explain why the word שׁוּקָא was not used. It is not clear what kind of the two rabbis performed in the market. In the opinion of R. Eleazar Askari they were , overseers of weights and measures, and Rebbi Ḥaggai recited a benediction before starting to go from stall to stall and checking the balances for correctness since that is a Biblical commandment repeated several times in the Pentateuch ( 25:15, 19:36) in addition to the prohibition of fraudulent business practices. The Rome manuscript has instead of בית חנוותא the expression לְמֵי חַטָּאתָה “the water for the ashes of the read heifer”, the drawing of which certainly would need a benediction. The Talmud reports that Rebbi Ḥaggai finished his Talmud studies with Rav Ḥuna I at age 18 and lived to be 160 years old; so, as shown in the commentary to Mishnah 1:1, he still could have seen ashes of the read heifer, but these could not have been preserved at the time of Rebbi Jeremiah who lived during the third and fourth generations of Amoraïm, even if these ashes were uniquely reserved for Cohanim eating . R. Zachariah Frankel wants to emend to בֵּית חַתְנוּתָא “place of a wedding” but his reading has no basis in antique or medieval sources.. Rebbi Ḥaggai was quick to recite a blessing. Rebbi Jeremiah said to him: You acted correctly because all commandments need a benediction. And from where that all commandments need a benediction? Rebbi Tanḥuma, Rebbi Abba bar Cahana in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: ( 24:12) “I want to give you the stone tablets, the Torah and the commandment in the verse is essential for R. Eleazar’s argument..” It brackets Torah and commandment. Just as Torah needs a benediction, a commandment also needs benediction. Rebbi Yoḥanan took an olive and recited a benediction before and after. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba was looking at him. Rebbi Yoḥanan said to him: Babylonian, why are you looking at me? Don’t you agree that everything from the Seven Kinds 8:8: “A land of wheat and barley, vine and fig, and pomegranate; a land of oil olive and (date) honey.” Since in v. 10 it is stated “when you will eat and be satiated, you must praise the Eternal, your God, for the good land that He gave you,” it follows that these kinds need a benediction afterwards that contains praise for food, land, (and Jerusalem.) This is called “one benediction in the kind of three”; the three benedictions are reserved for grain eaten in the form of bread. The benediction before is the applicable one of those mentioned in the Mishnah. needs a benediction before and after? He agrees. What is his problem? Because its pit reduces it. Does Rebbi Yoḥanan agree that its pit reduces it? What Rebbi Yoḥanan did was because of a creature) conjectures that R. Yoḥanan ate a large olive which even if pitted still has the size of an average olive. The Yerushalmi here is emphatic that any complete edible fruit needs a benediction before and after it is eaten, irrespective of size.. The word of Rebbi Yoḥanan implies that even one berry from a pomegranate needs a benediction before and after. 4:3 and Babli 50b.“Wine in its natural state, one says for it ‘Creator of the fruit of the tree’ and one may not use it to wash his hands; when it is mixed2:7., one says for it ‘Creator of the fruit of the vine’ and one may use it to wash his hands; these are the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, both pure and mixed one says over it ‘Creator of the fruit of the vine’ and one may use it to wash his hands.” Rebbi Abba said, it is not forbidden because of wasting food explains that the prohibition of the Sages (in the version of the Babli) refers to the sin of wasting food.. Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: On olive oil one recites “Creator of the fruit of the tree.” Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Pappus said before Rebbi Zeïra: The Mishnah says so. “Except for wine because on wine one says ‘Creator of the fruit of the vine’.” Is wine not mashed? But it says only “except for wine”, hence all other things even if they are mashed are recognizable in their state. Rebbi Abba said: Rav and Samuel both say, on cooked vegetable one says “that everything was created by His word.” Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Samuel: Large cooked pieces of , if they are recognizable one says on them “Creator of the fruit of the earth;” if one mashed them one says “He, by Whose word everything was created.” Rebbi Yose said, does the Mishnah say so? “Except for bread because on bread one says ‘He Who produces bread from the earth.’.” Is bread not mashed? But it says only “except for bread”, hence all other things even if they are mashed are recognizable in their state. 2:5. One word in the current text has been corrected following that Yerushalmi text. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: One says “Creator of the fruit of the tree” on marinated olives. Rebbi Benjamin bar Jephet in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: One says “By Whose word everything was created” on water-cooked vegetables. Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said: a Mishnah supports Rebbi Benjamin bar Yephet: (2:6) “but not marinated or cooked in water or cooked in broth”; if they were recognizable in their state one could fulfill his duty with them on Passover. Rebbi Zeïra said, who understands well what Rebbi Yoḥanan said, Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba or Rebbi Benjamin bar Yephet? Not Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba? And in addition from the fact that we see great rabbis going to a mourner’s meal, eat lupines and recite on them “Creator of the fruit of the earth;” Are not lupines certainly cooked? If you want, you may say there is a difference, since the Torah said “bitter herbs”, and cooked lupines have lost their bitterness. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, they have no disagreement. Since olives usually are eaten fresh, they are recognizable in their state even if they are marinated. Vegetables are changed once they are cooked).. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa: Rebbi Neḥemiah and the rabbis disagree. Rebbi Neḥemiah said: “Who produced bread from the earth.” But the rabbis say, “Who produces bread from the earth.” This disagreement is like that disagreement: לפת, Rebbi Ḥinena bar Isaac and Rebbi Samuel bar Immi; one said “, was it not bread?” and the other one said “, will it not be bread”? ( 72:16) “There will be a piece of flour on the land, on mountain tops. 92(6), which appears in the name of several other Amoraïm in Babli 30b, 111b.” Rebbi Jeremiah recited before Rebbi Zeïra “Who produced bread from the earth” and the latter praised him. Following Rebbi Neḥemiah? Not to amalgamate the letters but clearly be said in two distinct words.! If it is so, הַמִּין הָאָרֶץ and could be read together. However, the change proposed here makes no sense; nobody wants to pronounce a meaningless benediction that would be close to blasphemy. The question does not merit an answer.? In the opinion of Rebbi Neḥemiah, “He Who created the fruit of the vine”; in the opinion of the rabbis “Who creates the fruit of the vine.” Rebbi Zeriqan said: Rebbi Zeïra asked: He who took a lupine and was reciting the benediction over it when it fell from his hand, does he have to recite a second benediction? What is the difference between that and a water canal? They said, there he intended it from the start, but here he did not intend it from the start. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: One recites the benediction on bread only when one breaks it. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: This means that he who took a loaf and pronounced the benediction on it before it came to his hand, must recite a second benediction. Rebbi Tanḥum bar Yudan said, he must say “Praised be the Name of the Glory of His kingdom forever and ever,” in order not to utter the Name of Heaven in vain. How far may he break 8:10) is “when you will have eaten and will be satiated then you must praise the Eternal …”; the Biblical obligation applies only after a full meal. The rabbinic obligation explicitly applies to food that fills at least the volume of an olive; smaller amounts do not require Grace and, according the preceding paragraph, one may not recite Grace for such minute amounts. But since benedictions before eating are all rabbinic institutions, the problem is whether food in an amount less than the volume of an average olive must (or may) have a benediction and, if a benediction is recited on a larger loaf, whether the piece eaten immediately after the recitation of the benediction must be the size of an olive or not. The Babli (37b) has another angle to the problem. Since bread has a separate benediction from cereal and cakes, how small may the recognizable pieces of bread in cereal or soup be so that it still falls under the category of bread rather than cereal or soup?? Rebbi Ḥinena and Rebbi Mana, one says down to the size of an olive, the other says even smaller than the size of an olive. He who says down to the size of an olive, as it is stated “all7:4 that all flour offerings prepared in a vessel (baked or fried) must be broken into pieces before a handful of them is burned on the altar. There are two opinions on the size of admissible pieces (also reported Babli 37a). are crumbled into olive-size pieces.” He who says, smaller than the size of an olive: “Rebbi Ismael stated, even if he reduced it to its original form of fine flour.” It has been stated 4:7.: “On everything that needs three benedictions at the end one says ‘He Who produces bread from the earth’ at the start, but on everything that does not need three benedictions at the end one does not say ‘He Who produces bread from the earth’ at the start.” They objected: But if it is less than the size of an olive, one does not say three benedictions at the end. Does this mean that one should not say “He Who produces bread from the earth” at the start? Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, it is needed for other kinds. Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav: Those assembled may not taste anything before the one who recited the benediction did taste. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said: They may drink even if he did not drink. Do they disagree? Rav said in case all need the same loaf but Rebbi Joshua said when each one had his own cup in his hand. It has been stated: The one who recited the benediction takes first but if he wants to honor his teacher or someone who is greater than himself in Torah, he has the right to do so. When Rav was breaking bread he was eating with his left hand and distributing with his right hand. Rav Huna said: “Take and recite a benediction, take and recite a benediction” is not an interruption for the benediction; “give hay to the oxen” is an interruption for the benediction. Rab Ḥuna said: On is the same as Latin , a dish made by mixing pounded roasted flour or pounded roasted pea meal with water or vinegar (and other ingredients.) Its preparation is described in the Babli 36b and in great detail in the poem in [cf. E. and H. Guggenheimer, לשוננוּ vol. 36 (5733) pp. 105–112]. In the Babli ( 31a), the rule of R. Huna applies only to watery . This and the following rule are placed here to collect all formal statements of Rav Huna on benedictions for food. [An intermediate between and may be Greek μυττωτός “dish composed of pounded ingredients”, title of a poem by Virgil’s teacher Parthenios and model of Virgil’s (E. G.).], which is ground , one recites “that everything was created by His word”. Rav Huna said: If one put something into his mouth and forgot to recite the benediction, if it is fluid he spits it out, if it is food he puts it to one side. Rebbi Isaac bar Mari) he is called רִבִּי יִצְחָק קַסְקַסָּאָה, cf. Latin “old, old-fashioned” (E. G.). [The word קסקסים that appears in Tosephta and Babli is explained by Rashi as weeds, by S. Lieberman as rock outcrops in a field, from קשקשים “fins”, by J. Levy as clumps of earth or stones hewn from a rock.] before Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan even if it is food he takes it out since it is written ( 71:8) “May my mouth be full of Your praise 4:6. It is quoted in Babli 37a where, however, the formula “Creator of kinds of seeds” is replaced by “Creator of the fruit of the earth” since the Babli does not recognize any benediction for produce not mentioned by the majority opinion in the Mishnah., all day long of Your glory.” He who chews wheat kernels says on them “Creator of kinds of seeds.” If he baked or cooked them, as long as pieces are recognizable he recites on them “He Who produces bread from the earth” and afterwards three benedictions. If the pieces are not recognizable, he recites “Creator of kinds of food” and afterwards one benediction in the kind of three 4:6. It is quoted in Babli 37a where, however, the formula “Creator of kinds of seeds” is replaced by “Creator of the fruit of the earth” since the Babli does not recognize any benediction for produce not mentioned by the majority opinion in the Mishnah.. Down to which size are there pieces? Rebbi Yose bar Rebbi Abun, Cahana bar Malkiah in the name of Rav: down to olive-sized bits. He who chews rice says for it: “Creator of kinds of seeds.” If he baked or cooked it, even if there are recognizable pieces he says for it: “Creator of kinds of food” and he does not have to recite a benediction afterwards 4:7. Rebbi Jeremiah quotes the Tosephta in the Babli (37a) which also disagrees about the concluding benediction. The next paragraph will show that “no benediction afterwards” really means “no lengthy benediction afterwards”, only the short form.. Rebbi Jeremiah said, “Creator of the fruit of the earth.” Bar Marina recited before Rebbi Zeïra and Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba “By Whose word everything was created.” Rebbi Simeon the pious said “Creator of all sorts of delicacies.” Rebbi Yose bar Rebbi Abun said: They do not disagree. He who says “Creator of kinds of food”, if he made it into a ball. He who said “Creator of the fruit of the earth”, if it is separated) in which no individual kernels are visible.. He who said “By Whose word everything was created”, if it is cooked in water a long time. He who said “Creator of all sorts of delicacies”, if it is torn. That is beforehand. Afterwards, Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Simeon the pious: “He Who created all sorts of delicacies to delight with them the souls of all living. Praise to You, Eternal, for the Land and its delicacies.” Rebbi Abba bar Jacob in the name of the great Rebbi Isaac: When Rebbi was eating meat or an egg he used to say: “Creator of many living things to sustain with them all living souls. Praise to You, Eternal, Life of the worlds. That is at the end. At the start? Rebbi Ḥaggai said: “Creator of kinds of living things.” Rebbi Yose objected, does not the Mishnah (6:4) disagree? “On vinegar, on locusts, and on fallen fruits he says: “By Whose word everything was created.” And is a locust not a living thing? The statement of Rebbi Simeon the pious turns out like that of Rebbi and both of them like Rabban Gamliel 4:7. The first part of this Tosephta is quoted in Babli 37a., as it was stated: “The following is the principle: Rebbi Yehudah said in the name of Rabban Gamliel that on everything that is of the Seven Kinds but is not flour, or flour but not baked as bread, Rabban Gamliel says that he recites afterwards three benedictions; but the Sages say, one benediction. On everything that is neither from the Seven Kinds nor a kind of flour, Rabban Gamliel says he recites benedictions before and after, but the sages say before, but not after.” Rebbi Jacob bar Idi in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: Everything that is cereal and like dough put in boiling water and is of the Five Kinds on Passover because they can become sour: Wheat, barley, oats, rye, and spelt. Only these produce bread that needs full Grace and pastries that need “one benediction imitating three (or, in our text today, four) benedictions,” i. e., its text contains one sentence each for each benediction of full Grace., over it one says “Creator of kinds of foods”, and one recites after it one benediction imitating three. And everything that is cereal and like dough put in boiling water, but is not of the Five Kinds, Rebbi Jonah said that Rebbi Zeïra sent to those of the Yeshivah of Rebbi Yannai and they told him, but I do not know what they told him. What is it? Rebbi Yose said, it is reasonable to assume “That everything was created by His word.” Rebbi Jeremiah inquired: He who ate cereal, what does he recite at the end? Rebbi Yose said, and therefore Rebbi Jeremiah never ate any cereal. That is the only one thing about which he was in doubt. Why does one finish with “the Land”? It is similar to Grace for day laborers. As has been stated 5:24, Babli 16a. Day laborers who are paid by the hour and whose lunch break counts as worked time have the obligation to spend as little time as possible on their lunch and, in any case, their worship of God should not be paid by the employer except for the legal minimum.: “Workers who were doing work with the owner shall recite the first benediction, include Jerusalem in the benediction for the Land and finish with ‘the Land.’ But if they were working for their food or if the employer was eating with them, then they recite four benedictions.” In the school of Rebbi Yannai they treated it as a formula of benediction. Does one have to mention in it the occasion? Rebbi Abba bar Zamina said that Rebbi Zeïra used to mention the occasion in it. Rebbi Jeremiah said: Since Rebbi Zeïra took notice of it, so we have to take notice. It has been stated 4:15; a small part of it is quoted in Babli 39b as statement of Amoraïm. The problem is that only the first bread of a meal needs a benediction; all other foods of that meal can then be eaten without additional benedictions. The food that is chosen for benediction should be distinguished.: “One recites the benediction on the better kind of flour. Rolls and a full home baked loaf, one recites over a roll. A broken roll and a full home baked loaf, one recites on the full home baked loaf. Wheat bread and barley bread, one recites on wheat bread. A broken loaf of wheat bread and a full loaf of barley bread, one recites on the broken wheat bread. Barley bread and spelt bread, one recites on barley bread. But is not spelt bread better? But this is from one of the Seven Kinds, that one is not of the Seven Kinds.” Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: This is from Rebbi Yehudah, since Rebbi Yehudah said (Mishnah 4), “if there is among them a fruit of the Seven Kinds, on it he recites the benediction.” Impure bread and pure bread, Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, he recites on the pure one. Impure white bread and pure coarse() “coarse bread.” bread, Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: He may recite on the one that he prefers. Young palm shoots. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Samuel: He recites on it “Creator of the fruit of the tree.” Rebbi Ḥalaphta ben Saul stated, “By Whose word everything was created.” Rebbi Joshua stated: “Creator of kinds of grasses.” The of Rebbi Oshaiah disagrees: “The following are the kinds of grasses: artichoke, , the talmudic dictionary of 11th cent. R. Nathan of Rome, as mallow or okra. However, the Syriac dictionaries define the word as equivalent of Latin , “ox tongue”., , and lycium.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If he pronounced the benediction “Creator of the fruit of the soil” on fruits of the tree, he has fulfilled his obligation, on fruits of the soil “Creator of the fruit of the tree”, he has not fulfilled his obligation. On all of them if he pronounced “everything was created”, he has fulfilled his obligation. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa: This is Rebbi Yehuda’s since Rebbi Yehudah makes trees like straws 1:8 which states that if a tree was felled, its owner may not bring the first fruits of that tree to the Temple, but Rebbi Yehudah insists that he may. Since everybody agrees that grain may be offered as first-fruits, and grain can be brought only after it was cut and separated from the straw, it follows that Rebbi Yehudah treats trees simply as stalks for their fruits.. Rebbi Yose said, it is everybody’s opinion since fruits of a tree are also fruits of the soil but fruits of the soil are not fruits of the tree. Rav Huna said, except for bread and wine. The Mishnah (6:1) says so: Except for wine because on wine one says “Creator of the fruit of the vine;” except for bread because on bread one says “He Who produces bread from the earth.” It has been stated 4:5.: Rebbi Yose says, anyone who changes the formula established by the Sages did not fulfill his duty. Rebbi Yehudah says, everything that has been changed from the way it was created but one did not change its benediction, he did not fulfill his duty that the anonymous Mishnah should present the opinion of Rebbi Yehudah. In the parallel in the Babli (40b), Rebbi Yehudah’s opinion is not even quoted; in Babylonia only the opinions of Rebbi Yose (for those who know Hebrew) and of Rebbi Meïr (for the illiterate) are accepted.. Rebbi Meïr says, even if he says: “Praised be He Who created this property, how beautiful it is,” he has fulfilled his duty. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Samuel: practice follows Rebbi Meïr. The words of Rav also say so. A Persian came before Rav: “Since I am eating my piece of bread, but I do not know how to recite the benediction over it, I use to say: ‘Praise to Him Who created this piece of bread,’ did I fulfill my duty?” He said to him: yes. Rav Yehudah in the name of Abba bar bar Ḥana: Bar Qappara and two of his students were with the innkeeper at the “inn of blessings”. He brought before them partridge, orach, growing mainly in salt marshes, that was used as (relatively cheap) vegetable. [The identification of the plant (and of the bird species) is Rashi’s in the Babli, reported in the name of R. Isaac ben R. Yehudah of Worms.] The vegetable cannot be eaten raw, but must be cooked and, therefore, must have a changed benediction according to Rebbi Yehudah., and leeks and the use of the word in Syriac.. They said, if we recite the benediction on leeks, it will serve also for orach but not for the partridge mean that one may recite that benediction on anything that specifically needs it and then extend it to fruits and vegetables, only that if one recited the benediction on agricultural produce it also is valid, but not preferred.. If we recite on orach, it will not serve for anything else. One of them jumped the gun and recited “by Whose word everything was created” on the partridge. His colleague laughed at him. Bar Qappara said to that one, not about that glutton but about you scoffer. This one acted in his gluttony, why did you laugh? And to the other one he said, is there no rabbi here, is there no old man here? They said, within a year they both died. Rebbi Yose said, there two are gone and we did not learn anything from the incident. What is it? It is reasonable that one recites the benediction on leeks because “By Whose word everything was created” is secondary for vegetables.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If there were many kinds before him, Rebbi Yehudah said, if among them is one of the Seven Kinds 8:8: “A land of wheat and barley, vine and fig, and pomegranate; a land of oil olive and (date) honey.” Since in v. 10 it is stated “when you will eat and be satiated, you must praise the Eternal, your God, for the good land that He gave you,” it follows that these kinds need a benediction afterwards that contains praise for food, land, (and Jerusalem.) This is called “one benediction in the kind of three”; the three benedictions are reserved for grain eaten in the form of bread. The benediction before is the applicable one of those mentioned in the Mishnah. that is the one over which he recites the benediction. But the Sages say, on any one that he wishes. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, Rebbi Yehudah and the rabbis disagree only when he intended afterwards to eat bread, but if he did not intend to eat bread afterwards, everybody agrees that if among them one is of the Seven Kinds, that is the one over which he recites the benediction. Rebbi Abba said, he has to recite a benediction at the end. Rebbi Yose said, the statement of Rebbi Abba disagrees with Rebbi Joshua ben Levi since Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, Rebbi Yehudah and the rabbis disagree only when he intended afterwards to eat bread, but if he did not intend to eat bread afterwards everybody agrees that if among them is one of the Seven Kinds, that is the one over which he recites the benediction; but Rebbi Abba said, he has to recite a benediction at the end. If he did not recite a benediction at the end it became an accessory and we have stated there (Mishna 7): “In every situation where there is a main course and side dishes, one recites the benediction for the main course and thereby frees the side dishes.” 9, introduction) that it refers to a dessert. The translates the word by Italian קוציאי which Perles misread as “trestle; shell, hull”. Even “potsherd” does not make much sense. The older commentaries to the Yerushalmi were misled by a scribal “correction” in the that identified with lupines, which refers to the next word in the text. Levy’s dictionary, following Perles, derives the word from a non-existing Greek word γαρίσμη [but compare γαρισκός, ὁ, “an unknown fish”, γάρος, ὁ “paste of brine and small fish”, γάρον, τὸ “fish sauce”.] Jastrow considers the word as Par‘el from (Hebrew and Arabic) גזם “to cut in pieces”. From the usage in the next Halakhah it seems that one speaks of baked, in contrast to cooked, goods. It is possible to connect the word with Arabic جردو, גרדם “to devour voraciously” (said of worms and other pests.) The background of the remark is that this kind of dessert at a formal dinner, being extraordinary and not part of a regular meal, is not covered by the benediction over the bread at the start of the meal and, hence, needs its own benediction.. Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Ammi, he recites the benediction over the lupine. Rebbi Levi said, because of ( 22:22) “do not rob a poor one because he is poor.” That is if it is his intention to eat bread. But if it is not his intention to eat bread, that does not apply. (Rabban) Gamliel the twin went to those of the house of Rebbi Yannai. He saw them eat an olive and recite the benediction before and afterwards. He said to them: Does one do that? Rebbi Zeïra sent and asked Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman. Rebbi Cahana in the name of Rebbi Avina: Everybody agrees that if among them was one of the Seven Kinds, that is the one over which he recites the benediction. Rebbi Zeïra said, that must be correct, since we see the rabbis assembling for the proclamation of the New Moon and eat grapes but they do not recite a benediction afterwards. That is because it is his intention to eat bread. If there were before him of the Seven Kinds, on which one does he recite the benediction? There they say: Everything that has precedence in the verse has precedence for benediction and everything that is close to “the Land” has precedence over everything else 8:6): “A land of (1) wheat and (2) barley, (3) grapes, and (4) figs, and (5) pomegranates; a land of (1) oil olives and (2) date honey..",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If one recited the benediction on wine before the meal, he also covers wine after the meal. If one recited the benediction on little pieces form of פרר. This is the opinion of the dictionaries. It is more likely that פרפרת is derived from παραφέρω “to serve, bring to one’s side” (food), or the passive “set on table, served” (definitions of Liddell &amp; Scott). The correct translation then is “side dish before or after meal; appetizer or dessert, snacks.” The vocalization should be פָּרָפֶרֶת (E. G.). before the meal, he also covers little pieces after the meal. If one recited the benediction on bread, he also covers little pieces; if one recited the benediction on little pieces, he did not cover bread; the House of Shammai say, neither did he cover cooked food. HALAKHAH: Rav Ḥisda said, we stated only “if one recited the benediction on wine before the meal, he also covers wine after the meal”, but if one recited the benediction for wine during the meal, he did not cover the wine after the meal. There they say, even if one recited the benediction on wine before the meal, he did not cover wine after the meal. But did we not state “if one recited the benediction on wine before the meal, he also covers wine after the meal”? Rav Huna and Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, one of them said, if he drank spiced wine (scil., ); this wine cannot be compared to regular wine and therefore needs an extra benediction., the other one said, if he drank wine after the bath (plur.), a sauna. Since the first wine after return from the sauna is taken for medical reasons, its benediction does not cover wine consumed as food.. Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rav Huna, Rav, in the name of the great Rebbi Ḥiyya: Bread that comes -bread is called כעכ in Arabic. This is “pastry, small baked goods” in common Arabic, “donuts” in Syrian dialect. Rabbenu Ḥananel and Rashi explain that it is a baked shell filled with candied almonds and other nuts. Since it is baked it needs a benediction, but since it is not baked as bread it is not covered by the benediction over bread. The Babli (42a) quotes only the opinion of Samuel who seems to agree with Rebbi Yoḥanan here. needs a benediction before and after. Rebbi Ammi said that Rebbi Yoḥanan disagrees. Rebbi Mana asked Rebbi Ḥizqiah, in what does he disagree? When one ate from the same food during the meal? He said to him, even if one did not eat from the same kind during the meal. Rav Ḥaggai came in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: Even if one did not eat from the same kind during the meal. From the Patriarch they sent Nicolaus dates to Rebbi Ḥanina bar Sisai. He left them for dessert after his meal and recited a benediction over them before and after. Rav Ḥuna ate dates with his bread. Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said to him, are you disagreeing with your teacher? Leave them for dessert after your meal and you may recite a benediction over them before and after. He said to him, they are the main thing my teeth get to bite. Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose went to the marriage feast of Rebbi Ḥanina Eyntanaya. They brought before them bread after the meal. They said, let us leave our learning and let us bring a : Rebbi Mana stated in the name of Rebbi Yehudah, who said in the name of Rebbi Yose the Galilean: Bread that comes after the meal needs a benediction before and after. They said, since they are the minority and the rabbis disagree with them, let us act following the rabbis. Marinos, the son of Rebbi Joshua said: He who ate dessert 9, introduction) that it refers to a dessert. The translates the word by Italian קוציאי which Perles misread as “trestle; shell, hull”. Even “potsherd” does not make much sense. The older commentaries to the Yerushalmi were misled by a scribal “correction” in the that identified with lupines, which refers to the next word in the text.

Is he like the House of Shammai, since the House of Shammai say, “neither cooked food?” Rebbi Yose said, this is everybody’s opinion. If one recited the benediction on bread, he also covers little pieces and cooked food; the House of Shammai say, neither did he cover cooked food. But if one first recited the benediction over little pieces, everybody agrees that he covered neither bread nor cooked food. Rebbi Abba, the son of Rebbi Ḥaggai asked: He who ate cereal and he has the intention of later eating bread, does he have to recite a separate benediction for cereal at the end? The rabbis of Caesarea find it obvious that he has to recite a separate benediction at the end 16a) as making fun of “those stupid Babylonians who eat bread with bread” because they eat bread with cereal. Hence, in Caesarea, someone eating cereal is not presumed to have the intention to eat bread..",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If they were sitting, every one makes the benediction for himself. If they were lying on couches, one would make the benediction for everybody. If wine were served to them in the middle of the meal, everyone would make the benediction for himself; after the meal one person makes the benediction for everybody, and he makes the benediction on are spices or incense roasted on burning coals, used as air-freshener after a meal and also to perfume garments.. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, the Mishnah deals with a party for circumcision. Hence, it does not apply to a man in his own house. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated He allows a common benediction only in a formal dining room. The disagreement between him and R. Joshua ben Levi is not resolved; both are authorities of equal standing., even a man in his own house. It was stated 4:8; Babli 43a. This Tosephta explains the background of the Mishnah.: The order of a formal meal: Guests enter and sit on low benches. or on chairs until all of them are assembled. They are served wine; everyone makes the benediction for himself. They bringthem water, everyone washes one hand. They bring them snacks, everyone makes the benediction for himself. When they entered and lie down on couches they are served wine; even though one made the benediction on the first one, he must now make the benediction on the second one; one of them makes the benediction for all of them. They bring them water; even though one had washed one hand, he now has to wash both hands. When they are served snacks, one makes the benediction for all of them. No guest may enter after three servings of snacks. There (Mishnah 4:5) we have stated: “Sukkah seven days, how is this, is an additional festive day, where the obligation to live in a does not apply. Since one may not add to the commandments of the Torah ( 13:1), in Israel, where holidays are only one day, one may not live in the on the eighth day.? If he finished to eat he should not take down his extends until nightfall of the eighth day., but he takes out the vessels starting from the time of afternoon prayers because of the honor due to the last holiday.” Rebbi Abba bar Cahana, Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi in the name of Rav: A person must make his invalid. At the end of the discussion, the interpretation is that one must make the invalid as only if one intends to eat in the during the holiday of . One makes the invalid either by removing some of the roofing, or by putting up a sheet of cloth under the roofing, or in a similar way. as long as it is still day. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, a person must make inside his house, irrespective of the place of the meal.. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Samuel: If one made in one house and changed his mind to eat in another house he must make 101a that “there cannot be except at the place of the holiday meal.”. Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Ḥinena in the name of Rebbi Hoshaiah 4:5: Rebbi Hoshaiah in the name of Rav. In the sequel, this statement will be referred to either as Rebbi Hoshaiah’s or Rav’s.: He who loves his makes of the last holiday in his house and goes to eat in his must be said at the place of the meal.. Rebbi Abun said, they do not disagree. What Rav said was, if he did not have the intention to eat in another house, his intention was valid; a valid benediction cannot be voided retroactively.. But what Samuel said was if he had the intention to eat in another house. Rebbi Mana said invalid before the start of the eighth day if one wants to use it during that day; hence, if Rebbi Hoshaiah requires in Rav’s name that one make in the house it is obvious that he had the prior intention to eat in the . Hence, Rav must disagree with Samuel. If Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi made his statement without reference to Rav we may refer to the Babli ( 100b) that Rav disagrees explicitly with Samuel but that Rav Huna, Rav’s foremost student, agrees with Samuel. Rav Huna would not have gone against Rav if not at least one of the latter’s colleagues in his Yeshivah, e. g., Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi, had supported Samuel. Hence, the attribution of the statement of Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi to Rav seems to be in error, even though it is supported by both manuscripts of the Yerushalmi., Samuel comes like Rebbi he must require that be in that invalid . Ḥiyya and Rebbi Hoshaiah like Rebbi Joshua ben Levi in the house and then continue eating and drinking wine in the . This means that one may start drinking wine at one place and then continue drinking at another place without reciting a new benediction. This contradicts the previous Tosephta that the benediction over wine in the sitting room does not free one from reciting a new benediction in the dining room. Samuel (seconded by Rebbi Yoḥanan in Babli 101a/b) will agree to the conclusion from the Tosephta.. They asked Ben Zoma 4:12, Babli 43a.: Why, if wine was served to them in the middle of the meal, everyone makes the benediction for himself? He said to them, because the place of swallowing is not empty. Rebbi Mana said, this means that if someone sneezes during the meal one may not say to him “for health reads here זפ, Greek ζήτω “for life!” The Tosephta ( 7:5) declares this to be a non-Jewish custom.” because of danger to one’s life. What is the difference between and wine? Everybody smells , each person tastes wine. Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Jeremiah: One has to recite the benediction for as soon as the smoke rises. Rav Jeremiah wanted to examine Rebbi Zeïra. He said to him, which benediction does one recite on perfumed oil? He said, “He Who gave pleasant fragrance in perfumed oil.” He said to him, “He Who gave pleasant fragrance in spice wood.” Isaac bar Abba from Meḥasiah and Rav Ḥananel were sitting. One said, “Praise to Him Who gave pleasant fragrance in spice wood.” The other one said, “Praise to Him Who gave pleasant fragrance in the plants of the earth.” He who said “in the plants of the earth” objected to him who said “in spice wood”: are they wood? He answered him, is it not written ( 2:6) “She hid them in the hemp of wood”, are these wood? They went to the Yeshivah of Rav and heard Rav Huna in the name of Rav: “He Who gave pleasant fragrance in spice wood.” Ganiva said, he who uses oil for dirt does not have to recite a benediction. Rebbi Yudan said, even if he collects it into his hand. Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rav Huna in the name of Rav: He who sprinkles “sweet smelling” (E. G.). Most authors equate the word with , “ointment made from olive oil”; this fits neither the spelling of the word nor the context. in his house does not have to recite a benediction. Rav Ḥisda said, on everything he recites “He Who gave pleasant fragrance in spice wood” except for musk on which he recites “He who gave pleasant fragrance in all kinds of spices.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Three persons who ate together are required to “invite”. If one ate must be eaten by a Cohen’s family in ritual purity. There is no rate set for in the Torah but in times when ritual purity can be observed, the rabbinically established rate was 2 percent. Next, the tithe of 10% must be given to a Levite. This again is subject to a 10% to be given to the Cohen. The remainder of this is secular private property of the Levite and need not be kept in purity. However, consumption by a non-Cohen of any food containing still (and of impure by a Cohen) is a deadly sin. In Temple times it was established that all Jews, educated and uneducated, observant and nonobservant alike, did separate and give it to a Cohen. However, the first tithe was not given by a substantial minority of uneducated and nonobservant. Since untithed produce still contains the and its consumption would be a deadly sin, it was instituted that observant Jews have to separate at least the for produce bought from unreliable sources. Since a majority of all agricultural producers did give the tithe, the obligation to tithe is conditional and is waved for the poor. Produce sold by unreliable persons is called ; the rules under which has to be given are spelled out in a separate Tractate. In any case, since any person might give away all his property and then become poor and eat without tithing, is potentially permitted food for everybody and the person who eats it does not commit blasphemy in reciting Grace., or first tithe of which the heave was taken, or second tithe or dedicated foods that were redeemed, or the waiter who ate the volume of an olive, or a Samaritan 17) who accepted the written Torah but not the oral law. [Since they did not resist the effort made by Diocletian to unify the Roman Empire in pagan rite, this statement of the Mishnah no longer applies. It does apply, however, to Karaites.], these can be invited. But if one ate untithed produce, or first tithe of which the heave was not taken, or the second tithe or dedicated foods that were not redeemed, or the waiter who ate less than the volume of an olive, or a Gentile, these cannot be invited. HALAKHAH: Here 45a and , on Mishnah 5. it has been said “they are not allowed to split” and here it has been said “they are required to ‘invite’ ”. Samuel said, one is at the start and one is at the end. What means “beginning” and what means “end”? Two Amoraïm; one said if they decided to eat together that is the start, when they ate the volume of an olive that is the end. But the other one said, if they ate the volume of an olive that is the start, when they finished their meal that is the end. Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav Huna, Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Abba bar Jeremiah: Three are required, two have permission. Rebbi Zeïra said this before Rebbi Yasa. He said to him: I have only the Mishnah, three who ate together are required to “invite”. The rabbis of here stick by their opinion, the rabbis of there; in Babli (5b/6a) this is a disagreement between Samuel and Rebbi Abbahu, student of R. Simeon ben Laqish and R. Yoḥanan. The Babli ( 45b) only hints that the difference has its roots in different local traditions. stick by their opinion. Samuel said, two who judged, their judgment is valid but they are called an insolent court. Rebbi Yoḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish both say, two who judged, their judgment is invalid. Rav Huna said, three who ate each one by himself and then came together do “invite”. Rav Ḥisda said, only if they came from three groups. According to the opinion of Rebbi Zeïra and his group, only if all three ate together ( 5:23, cf. end of Halakhah 5) that people in a caravan, if they eat while walking, cannot recite Grace together even if they all ate from the same food, but if they sit together at a rest stop, they must recite Grace together even if everyone ate his own provisions. In contrast to the Babli, the Yerushalmi never entertains the thought that for common Grace one would have to lie down on couches.. Rebbi Jonah on that of Rav Huna: If he dipped three stalks of hyssop each one by himself and then took them together, he may sprinkle with it 19, Mishnah ). A “bunch” is a minimum of three stalks. The opinions here are attributed to the older authorities by Rebbi Jonah.. Rav Ḥisda said, only if they came from three bundles. According to the opinion of Rebbi Zeïra and his group, only if all three were dipped together. If you want to say that we do not infer rules of hyssop from rules of benedictions, do we not see the rabbis deal with and learn from pourable mud?. As we have stated (Mishnah 1:10): “If the roofing was three hand-breadths away from the walls it is invalid. is that its roof must be botanical (but only materials that cannot become ritually unclean). The branches or other material must be arranged so that there is more shadow than sun inside the . If there is a place where that condition is not satisfied for three hand-breadths horizontally from a wall, the cannot be used to fulfill the commandment “to dwell” in it ( 23:42).” Hence less than that is acceptable. May one sleep under that? Rebbi Isaac ben Elyashib answered, pourable mud completes a , about 135 gallons. If there is not enough clear water, the desired volume can be obtained by adding mud that is so moist that it can be poured from a bucket (Mishnah 7:1). The complete argument is in Yerushalmi 1:10, Babli 19a. but one may not immerse in it, here also it completes the but one may not sleep under it. Three who ate together and one wants to leave, Rav said he should recite the first benediction, then he may leave. What is the first benediction? In the Yeshivah of Rav they said, the benediction of invitation. Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Jeremiah: that is “He Who feeds all.” Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rav Ḥanan in the name of Rav: that is “He Who feeds all.” Rav Sheshet objected, but a disagrees: “Two, three are obliged to recite Grace. is according to Alfassi: If two or three people sit together and neither of them knows how to recite the entire Grace but each of them knows one or two benedictions that the others do not, then they take turns in reciting the benedictions and they all have fulfilled their obligations, the one reciting by pronouncing the benediction and the others by listening and answering “Amen”. The numbers are important to show that we require one person to recite an entire benediction; it is not permissible to split one benediction among several people. Hence, the maximal number of people who can share in reciting Grace is the number of benedictions in Grace.” If you want to say the benediction of invitation is the first one, one should state “four.” They found stated “four.” If you want to say this is “He Who feeds all”, it is difficult. If you want to say that it is “He Who is good and does good”, you cannot do that, there is a difference because Rav Huna said that “He Who is good and does good” was fixed (Northvale NJ, 1995) p. 358–359. after permission was received to bury the slain of Betar, “He Who is good” because the dead did not decompose and “He Who does good” that they could be buried. Rav Huna said, you may explain it following Rebbi Ismael since Rebbi Ismael said Ba 16., “He Who is good and does good” is an obligation from the Torah as it is written (8:10): , that is the benediction of invitation; t, that is “He Who feeds all”; , that is the benediction over the Land; , that is the benediction “builder of Jerusalem” [and so it says ( 3:25) “this good mountain and the Lebanon 10:34) “the Lebanon will fall through a powerful one” (Babli 56b; Yerushalmi sources: 4, 1).”]; , that is “He Who is good and does good”. For Torah there is written a benediction before, but no benediction is written after. What is written before it? ( 32:3) “For I am invoking the name of the Eternal, attribute greatness to our God.” For food there is written a benediction after, but no benediction is written before. What is written after it? ( 8:10): “You will eat and be satiated, then you must praise”. From where that which is said about one on the other and vice-versa? Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥmani in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: The Name is mentioned in both verses as parallel expressions one has a tradition that two equal or synonymous expressions are written in the Torah for purposes of comparison and these two words are not used for any other inference, all laws connected with one word apply to the other and vice-versa. The derivation here does not fulfill these conditions; hence, it is labelled to follow the rules of R. Aqiba who is not known to require too much formality in case the verse is used to give a biblical base to an old tradition.. Just as the Name that is mentioned concerning Torah implies a benediction before, so the Name that is mentioned concerning food implies a benediction before. And just as the Name that is mentioned concerning food implies a benediction after, so the Name that is mentioned concerning Torah implies a benediction after. That follows Rebbi Aqiba on . The problem of both Rebbi Aqiba and Rebbi Ismael is that in its mishnaic-talmudic form, the rules of Jewish conduct form a logically consistent whole. It was shown earlier in this chapter, Notes 24 – 29, that rules must be consistent from one application to the next, such as rules of Grace and forming a court of law. But the basis of these laws, the words of the Torah, are unsystematic, fragmentary, and sometimes appear contradictory. Hence, one needs a method of translating the aphoristic text of the Torah in a legally consistent new language; cf. the author’s , in: Confrontations with Judaism, ed. P. Longworth, Blond, London 1966, 171–196. The rules are discussed in the medieval texts by R. Samuel Hanaggid and of R. Simson of Sens.. What following Rebbi Ismael? Rebbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rebbi Ismael, an inference from the lesser to the greater in the name of R. Yoḥanan only and points out that the application here is not justified since it is self-contradictory. The Yerushalmi seems to be of the opinion that in the formulation given here, with “not more stringent” instead of “less stringent”, the argument is logically admissible.. If food that needs no explicit benediction before, needs a benediction afterwards, regarding Torah that needs a benediction before, it is only logical that it should need a benediction afterwards. That works for Torah; what about food? If Torah that needs no benediction afterwards, needs a benediction before, regarding food that needs a benediction afterwards, it is only logical that it should need a benediction before. Rebbi Isaac and Rebbi Nathan say, ( 9:13): “For he will recite the benediction over the sacrifice and after that the invited guests will eat.” () this is given in the name of R. Nathan only. A verse from Samuel (Biblical but not Pentateuchal) cannot prove a commandment but can prove a practice. Rebbi Nathan said, ( 23:24) “you shall serve the Eternal, your God and give praise for your bread and your water”; when is it called your bread and your water, before you eat. Rebbi said, if he has to give praise when he ate and is satiated, somuch more at a time when he is hungry for food. That is for food, what about Torah? If food, which sustains only temporary life, needs a benediction before and after, Torah, which sustains eternal life, so much more this is a קל וחוֹמר of Rebbi Ismael.. Rebbi Zeïra asked: These three that are called 21b there is a : “(In reading the Torah) he who starts recites the benediction before and he who finishes recites the benediction after.” On that, the Gemara notes: But today, all recite benedictions before and after. This “today” may be long after the work on the Yerushalmi stopped. In any case, the seems to represent the early Babylonian practice; we do not know of any direct Yerushalmi source that let people read the Torah without benediction. Rebbi Zeïra, the Galilean head of academy who had come from Babylonia, is the right person to ask for the reasons and the correct practice. Since his questions remain without answers, both practices might be acceptable. Both the preceding paragraph and R. Zeïra’s question presuppose that private Torah reading requires benedictions before and after, cf. מסכת סופרים Chap. 13 and Ezra Fleischer, קטעים מקובצי תפילה ארץ־ישראליים מן הגניזה, קובץ על יד יג (כג) 139–141, 188–189., how are you treating them? As three who ate together or as three who ate each one for himself? If you treat them as three who ate together then the first one recites the benediction before, the last one recites the benediction after, and the middle one does not recite any benediction at all. If you treat them as three who ate each one for himself then even the middle one recites benedictions before and after. Rebbi Samuel ben Eudaimon said, they did learn the benedictions for the Torah from Grace 4:1; the Venice print has here “benediction of ‘invitation’ ”, a scribal error הזימון for המזון. only in public 1:8), one benediction in the morning is enough to cover all Torah study during the day and evening; one does not have to recite a new benediction for study after an interruption. The prayer manuals of Yerushalmi type (see Note 48) which have benedictions after the reading of Pentateuch, Prophets, and Hagiographs require these only for reading the Bible, not oral Torah study.. If in public, then in private one should not recite any benediction! Rebbi Abba Mari, the brother of Rebbi Yose, said: They made it equal to other commandments of the Torah. Just as other commandments of the Torah need benedictions, this also needs a benediction 32:3, is clearly addressed to the public and, therefore, not applicable to private study.. “If one ate .” This means that, if one ate produce which perhaps was tithed and were taken so that it may be consumed without incurring guilt and perhaps was not tithed, one invites him. Rebbi Simeon, the brother of Rebbi Berekhiah: At the time when they were instituting , most of the unlearned brought the harvest into their houses and tithe starts when produce is brought through the door of the house (or barn). The expression here implies that most of the unlearned followed the rules and ate only produce that was in order; only because of the severity of the offense of eating was the rule of decreed since a minority of uneducated did not follow the rules for produce sold; in that case the probablity of having produce that was not in order was less than 50%. There is therefore no inference possible for the problem under discussion, where the probability of things being wrong is 50%.. Which one says that? “One invites the Samaritan.” And is that Samaritan not doubtful? Rebbi Abba said, explain it following what is said for him the Mishnah simply declares that Samaritans are counted as Jews and no inference is possible for our case. The question is left without answer.: A Samaritan is like a Gentile, the words of Rebbi. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, a Samaritan is like a Jew in all respects.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: One does not ‘invite’ women, slaves, and minors. What is the minimum to ‘invite’? Down to the size of an olive, Rebbi Yehudah says to the size of an egg. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, Rebbi Yose ben Shaul in the name of Rebbi: One makes a minor an appendix for ten services. Rebbi Yose ben Shaul was a student of Rebbi. He transmits sayings of Rebbi only.. But did we not state: One does not investigate a minor is quoted in Babli 47b: “A minor who grew two pubic hairs may take part in ‘invitation’, a minor who did not grow two pubic hairs may not take part in ‘invitation’ but one does not investigate a minor.” The other version is in Tosephta 5:18: “A minor who can eat an olive may take part in ‘invitation’, a minor who cannot eat an olive may not take part in ‘invitation’; one does not investigate a minor.” Most commentators refer the Yerushalmi to the version in Berakhot but it seems clear that the Yerushalmi is based on a text close to the Tosephta and emphatically disagrees with the Babli, cf. , ? Rebbi Yose said, one confirms Rebbi Simon, Rebbi Ḥanina, Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi 91; there it says correctly “Rebbi Yose said, one confirms Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi”. The last part of the Tosephta implies that if a boy is on the threshhold of manhood (), one can make him take part in any ceremony that needs ten adults by simply asking him if he is of age; one does not have to investigate if what he says is true. The implication here is that if one has a boy who looks younger than the age of puberty, one certainly cannot take him as tenth man.: it is needed for two minors; if he is a minor, one considers him doubtful, if he is doubtful, one considers him certain. Rebbi Yehudah ben Pazi in the name of Rebbi Yose: nine that look like ten, does one “invite” only those that are certain? Also if a minor was among them? Rebbi Berekhiah said that Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi asked before Rebbi Yose: “What are we dealing with? There one makes him an appendix for ten, one should say that here one should make him an appendix for three. Since there one makes him an appendix for the mention of the Divine Name, here, when one does not mention the Divine Name, should one make him an appendix.” He answered him: “It is not ! There, since they must mention the Name, one makes him anappendix; here, since one does not recite the Name, there is no need to make him an appendix!” It has been stated: One may take a minor and a Torah scroll as appendix. Rebbi Judan said: So is the : One may take a minor as appendix for the purpose of Torah reading is close to a statement of Rav Huna in the Babli (47b) which there is corrected differently.. When does one start to make him an appendix? Rebbi Avina said: Rab Ḥuna and Rav Yehudah disagreed, both in the name of Samuel. One said, that he has to understand the nature of a benediction; the other one said that he has to understand to Whom one has to recite the benediction. Rebbi Nassa said, many times did I eat with my father Taḥlipha and my uncle Aninia bar Sisai and they did not recite the ‘invitation’ with me until I grew two pubic hairs. Samuel bar Shilat asked before Rav, but some say that it was asked before Rav Samuel bar Shilat: Nine ate bread and one ate vegetable? He said to them: One ‘invites’. Eight ate bread and two ate vegetable? He said to them: One ‘invites’. Seven ate bread and two ate vegetable? He said to them: One ‘invites’. Rebbi Avina asked: What is the rule for half and half? Rebbi Zeïra said, as long as I was there, I would have needed that. I regret that I did not ask. Rebbi Jeremiah asked: May he who ate vegetable recite Grace? Rebbi Jeremiah seems to contradict himself! It has been stated: 300 could terminate his vow only if he offered a sheep as holocaust sacrifice, a female sheep for a sin-offering, and a goat for a family sacrifice ( 6). Most of these were poor people who relied on charity to fulfill their obligations in the Temple. came in the days of Simeon ben Shetaḥ. For 150 of them he found an opening regret his original decision to become a ; this invalidates the vow retroactively so that no sacrifice may be brought., for 150 of them he did not find an opening. He came to king Yannai and said to him: There are here 300 who need 900 sacrifices. You should give half of them from your side, I shall give half from my side. The king sent him 450 animals. An informer went around and said that the other one had not given anything from his own money. King Yannai heard about it and got angry. Simeon ben Shetaḥ feared and fled. After some time, important people from the Persian empire came to king Yannai. At the meal, they said to him: We remember that there was here an old man who gave us a rabbinic discourse. He told them what had happened. They said to him, send and bring him! He sent and gave him his word; he came and sat between king and queen. He said to him, why did you trick me? He said, I did not trick you; you with your money and I with my learning, as it is written ( 7:12) “In the shadow of wisdom, in the shadow of money.” He said to him, why did you disappear? He said to him, I heard that my lord was angry with me and I wanted to fulfill the verse ( 26:20) “Hide a little bit until the rage passes;” he used about himself ( 7:12): “Knowledge is an advantage, wisdom lets its possessor live.” He said to him, why did you sit between king and queen? He said to him, it is written in the book of Ben Sirach: “Esteem it and it will raise you and set you between princes.” He said, bring him a cup that he may recite Grace. He took the cup and said: “Let us give praise for the food that Yannai and his company ate.” He said to him, are you still obstinate as ever? He said to him, what should I say, “for the food that we did not eat?” He said, bring him something that he may eat. They brought, he ate and recited: “For the food that we ate.” Rebbi Yoḥanan said, his colleagues disagree with Simeon ben Shetaḥ. Rebbi Jeremiah said, about the first action 51. [In the Babli, 48a, it is R. Abba the son of R. Ḥiyya bar Abba in the name of R. Yoḥanan who declares that Grace cannot be recited by someone who did not eat bread. But the Babli cannot be used for the text of the Yerushalmi.]; Rebbi Abba said, about the second action. Rebbi Jeremiah seems to contradict himself! There he wondered about it and here it is obvious for him! He wondered following the Sages; it is obvious for him following Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. We have stated about this: If one was lying on a couch and ate 5:5, and the prints of the Midrash, this is labelled “words of the Sages.” But in the Tosephta (5:20) and manuscripts of the Midrash (and in the Babli 48a), the statement is attributed to Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. It seems that the attribution here to the Sages is a scribal error since the opinion attributed to Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel in the last is the one given in the Tosephta and R. Jeremiah is reported as following the latter’s opinion in the interpretation of the story of Simeon ben Shetaḥ. with them, even if he did not eat grain the volume of an olive one ‘invites’ with him, the words of the Sages. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: One never ‘invites’ anyone unless he had eaten grain the volume of an olive. But did we not formulate, “two bread and one vegetable, then one ‘invites’?” This follows Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: How does one ‘invite’? If there are three, he says: let us praise. If there are three in addition to himself, he says: praise! If there are ten, he says: let us praise our God. If there are ten in addition to himself, he says: praise! There is no difference between ten and ten myriads. If there are a hundred, he says: let us praise the Eternal, our God. If there are a hundred in addition to himself, he says: praise! If there are a thousand, he says: let us praise the Eternal, our God, the God of Israel. If there are a thousand in addition to himself, he says: praise! If there are ten thousand, he says: let us praise the Eternal, our God, the God of Israel, God of Hosts, Who thrones over the Cherubim, for the food that we ate. Rebbi Yose the Galilean says, the praise has to be according to the multitude of the assembled, as it is said ( 68:27): “In assemblies praise God, the Lord, from the root of Israel.” Rebbi Aqiba said, do we not find in the synagoge that one recites “Praise the Eternal” whether there are many or few? Rebbi Ismael says, “Praise the Eternal, the Praised One!” HALAKHAH: Clarification. Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, and Rebbi Ḥanina the colleague of the rabbis, were sitting and eating together. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa took the cup and said “let us praise”, he did not say: “praise!”. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba asked him, why did you not say “praise!” He said to him, did we not state 5:18, Babli 50a.: “One does not insist on the formulation. Whether he says ‘let us praise’, or he says ‘praise!’, one does not criticize him, but the pedants is נקרנין “nitpickers.” The Babli (50a) interprets the Tosephta to mean that “praise!” is acceptable but not preferred; the Yerushalmi seems to accept Samuel’s statement (also Babli 49b) at face value that “praise!” should not be used in practice. criticize him for that.” Rebbi Zeïra felt badly that Rebbi Jacob bar Abba had called Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba a pedant. Samuel said: I do not want to exclude myself from the group. They objected: look at the benediction for the Torah where he says “praise!” Rebbi Abun said, since he will conclude by “the Praised One”, he does not exclude himself from the group. Rebbi Abba bar Zamina waited upon Zeïra and mixed him a cup. He said to him: Old man, make the benediction, and have the intention of drinking another one, as we have stated: The waiter makes a benediction for every single cup 107b), this is a statement of Rav and is restricted there to formal dinners. The Babli also quotes an opinion of the Galilean R. Yoḥanan that for solid food also the waiter cannot make a benediction for the uncertain future; since this is not mentioned here one has to conclude that the Yerushalmi rejects the distinction made in the Babli. but not for every morsel. He answered him: Just as I have the intention of absolving you of your obligation by the benediction so you must have the intention of absolving me of my obligation but is valid for all obligations that may be fulfilled by listening.) by “Amen”. Rebbi Tanḥum bar Jeremiah said, a Mishnah ( 4:8) states this: The absent-minded in order to learn the technique cannot by the same act fulfill his obligation, neither can anyone who hears him. But in our application, the intended meaning is “absent-minded.” R. Abba bar Zamina’s implication is that in hearing a benediction one must answer “Amen” in order to make sure that the listener is not absent-minded either. This explains the placing of this paragraph here, following another one where also one person recites Grace in order for all others (even a hundred thousand) to be freed from their obligation. did not fulfill his obligation and he who heard from the absent-minded did not fulfill his obligation. “If there are a hundred” etc. Rebbi Yoḥanan said, these are the words of Rebbi Jose the Galilean, but the Sages say “there is no difference between ten and ten myriads”. Rava 1:3 (fol. 60b)] as Rebbi (!) Abba bar Josef [in the parallel in the Babli, based on the Yerushalmi, his full name is given as Rava bar Rav Josef bar Ḥama in contrast to Babylonian material where his name consistently is only Rava]. In the Babli, (50a) Rava is quoted as saying that “the people follow R. Ismael”, i. e., there is no binding ruling in the matter but a silent consensus, whereas the statement in the Yerushalmi indicates a rabbinic ruling. said, practice follows him who states that there is no difference between ten and ten myriads. From where that “congregation” means ten people 19:2 “Speak to the entire congregation of the children of Israel and tell them: conduct yourselves in holiness because I, The Eternal, your God, Am Holy” and 22:32 “I shall be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel.” The same discussion is reported 4:4, 1:4. The parallel discussion in the Babli, 23a, in the name of the first generation Rebbi Ḥiyya, is based on the second verse and is intelligible only if it is understood as reference to the derivation in the Yerushalmi.? Rebbi Abba and Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: It is said here “congregation” and it says there 19:2, “there” to 14:27: “How long for this evil congregation”, speaking of the ten spies who argued against entering the Land. There were twelve spies in all; Joshua and Caleb were in the opposition; accordingly there were ten evil persons who formed the congregation. “congregation”. Since “congregation” mentioned there means ten, so also “congregation” mentioned here must mean ten. Rebbi Simon said, it is said here “in the midst” and it is said there “in the midst” ( 42:5): “The sons of Israel came to buy grain in the midst of those who came.” Since “in the midst” said there means ten, so also here it must mean ten. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said to him, if you deduce from “in the midst”, there are too many of them 22:32, “in the midst” must mean 600’000 adult males. In the Babli, 22:32 is used to establish a formal parallel, known as , between this verse and the one from Genesis. The latter verse is then used to arrive at the number ten (since of the twelve tribes, Joseph and Benjamin were missing). From the Babli it seems that there was a tradition linking the two verses (since in its opinion, must be based on a tradition) and, therefore, R. Simon is forced to quote a verse that in itself seems to be less adequate than the one used before.. But it is said here “the children of Israel” and it is said there “the children of Israel.” Since “children of Israel” said there means ten, so here it also must mean ten. How do the Sages use the reason of Rebbi Yose the Galilean? “In assemblies”, in each separate congregation. Rebbi Ḥanina the son of Rebbi Abbahu said, it is written במקהלת to support the position of the Sages; the Masorah to 32:25/26 (composed several centuries after the conclusion of the Talmudim) notes that מקהלת appears as geographical name only in and that in Psalms, מקהלוֹת is a . The parallel Babli (50a) refers the verse in Psalms, in the name of R. Meir, to the choir of children at the Red Sea, a tradition more justly attributed to Rabban Gamliel in Yerushalmi 5:6.. Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi rose to read in the Torah and said “Praise the Eternal,” he did not add “the Praised One!” They wanted to silence him. Rav said to them, let him, because he follows Rebbi Aqiba in reciting liturgical poems in the prayers, whereas the autochthonous Yeshivah of Pum Beditha (Nahardea) never recited them.] Rav Ḥiyya Bar Ashi became a member of Rav’s Yeshivah but kept the old Babylonian following Rebbi Aqiba. Rav had to explain to his students that this way also is acceptable. The parallel in the Babli (50a) tells a similar story about Rafrem bar Papa, a student of Rav’s student Rav Huna; there, Rava notes that even in Babylonia “the people follow Rebbi Ismaël.” This shows that common practice was settled only three generations after Rav. (The Rome ms. has “Rav Ada” instead of “Rav”. Since Rav Ada was one of Rav’s students, ranking much below Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi, the reading has to be rejected.). Rebbi Zeïra rose to read as Cohen in place of a Levite and recited the benediction before and after. They wanted to silence him. Rav Hiyya bar Ashi said to them, let him, because that is their way of doing it 3:1, was that the first to read in the Torah pronounced the benediction before the reading and the last one the benediction after the reading. Even in Mishnaic times it became customary that every reader recited his own benediction. Here, Rebbi Zeïra had read his portion as Cohen; in the absence of a Levite he was called a second time to read and he started by reciting the benedictions again. It is reported in the Babli ( 16b) that R. Zeïra studied some time in the Yeshivah of R. Ḥiyya bar Ashi after having been ordained by Rav Yehudah and before his immigration to Galilee. The action of R. Zeïra, therefore, reflects the practice of the Yeshivah of Nahardea.. It is written ( 8:6): “Ezra praised the Eternal, the great God.” In what did he declare Him great? He declared Him great by the Explicit Name. Rav Mattanah said, he declared Him great by a benediction. Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Why are they called the Men of the Great Assembly 3:8; in Babli 69b it is spelled out that Rav Mattanah means the first benediction of the that contains the sentence “the Great, Strong, and Awesome God” chosen by the Men of the Great Assembly, and the observation of R. Joshua ben Levi is intended to buttress the argument of Rav Mattanah.? Because they returned the Crown to its former status. Rebbi Phineas said, Moses fixed the formula of benediction, ( 10:17) “the Great, Strong, and Awesome God.” Jeremiah said ( 32:18): “the Great, Strong God,” but he left out “Awesome.” Why did he say “the Strong”? He may rightly be called strong because He sees the destruction and is silent. And why did he not say “the Awesome”? Awesome is only the Temple, as it is said ( 68:36): “Awesome is the Eternal from Your holy place.” Daniel said ( 9:4) 1:5.: “the Great and Awesome God,” he did not say “the Strong”; His sons are put in neck-irons “neck-iron.”, where is His strength? Why did he say: “the Awesome?” He may well be called “the Awesome” by the wonders He did for us in the fiery oven. But when the Men of the Great Assembly came,they restituted Greatness to its former place, “the Great, Strong, and Awesome God.” Does flesh and blood have power to set limits in these matters? Rebbi Isaac ben Eleazar said, the prophets know that their God is Truth and they will not fawn before him.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Three who ate together are not permitted to split, neither are four or five. Six may split and so on up to ten. Ten may not split and so on unless they are twenty. HALAKHAH: It was stated: If one was eating sitting down on Sabbath and forgot and did not mention Sabbath, Rav said: he must repeat, and Samuel said: he need not repeat 8:10 cannot be a reason for repeating Grace.. Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: If one is in doubt whether he mentioned the New Moon or did not mention it, one does not make him repeat Babli have “Rav” instead of “Samuel”; this seems to be the correct reading. According to the Babli, one does not have to repeat even if he is sure that he did not mention the day; according to the way the Yerushalmi quotes the formulation, one has to repeat even if there was only a doubt that he did not mention the day.. They found a dissenting statement: On every day that has a sacrifice (e. g., the day of the new moon and the intermediate days of holidays,) he must mention the occasion and if he did not mention it, one makes him repeat. But on every day that has no sacrifice (e. g., Hanukkah and Purim,) he must mention the occasion but if he did not, one does not make him repeat. Ḥanan bar Abba and the colleagues were eating on Sabbath. After they had eaten and recited Grace he got up and left. When he returned, he found them reciting Grace. He said, did we not recite Grace already? They said to him, we recited, but now we recite again because we forgot to mention the Sabbath. Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav Huna (Rav Jeremiah extends it in the name of Rav) did not say so: If he forgot to mention the Sabbath, he says: He Who gave rest to His people Israel. Here if he turned his mind away, there if he did not turn his mind away. It is stated 5:23. In both these texts, the second sentence reads “if they sat down to eat”; this is interpreted in the Babli to mean that they are sitting together by a common decision. Hence, they form a group and have to recite Grace together. The language of the Yerushalmi, “they sat down and ate,” points to a spontaneous act that would not require Grace to be recited in common in the opinion of the Babli.: Ten people walking on the road, even if all of them eat from the same loaf, each one recites Grace for himself. If they sat down and ate, even though each one eats his own loaf, one recites Grace for all of them. Rebbi Jeremiah “invited” his colleagues at an inn.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Two groups that ate in one house, if some of one group saw some of the other group they join in “invitation”; otherwise, each group recites the “invitation” for itself. One does not recite a benediction over wine unless he added water; these are the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, one may recite the benediction. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Abba bar Zamina in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: For two houses, there is a problem 50b read the statement as: “[The Mishnah] is only needed for two houses,” the inference being that if they see one another they can join in saying Grace. This transfers the meaning of Babylonian צריכא (“it is necessary”) to the Palestinian expression נצרכה (“it is problematic”) used here!}. Rebbi Yoḥanan said, it applies only if they entered with that in mind. What do you do with those at the house of the patriarch, like one house or like two houses? Let us say that if they usually walk over from one group to the other then they “invite” together; otherwise they do not “invite” together. Rebbi Berekhiah used to place his speaker in the middle of the door of the house of study and he recited the “invitation” together with both groups. “One does not recite a benediction over wine unless he added water; these are the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, one may recite the benediction.” Rebbi Zeriqa in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: The Sages agree with Rebbi Eliezer that one has to add a small amount of water into the cup used for Grace. The rabbis do so for the cup. The statement of Rebbi Yose disagrees with Rebbi Jonah, for Rebbi Jonah tasted it and restored it of Friday evening, then left the rest standing in the cup and “repaired” it the next morning by filling it again with more wine. As will be explained later in this Halakhah, a cup that has been drunk from cannot be used for another benediction; hence, it has to be replenished. The question is, if R. Jonah put water into his cup, how could he leave it standing half full through the night?. If you imply that it was mixed, did we not formulate: He who drinks mixed drinks that were standing through the night, his blood is on his head. Rebbi Yoḥanan said, that is only if it was standing in metal vessels 17a); the is very close to the text in Chapter 11. Both of these sources give a list of things that are dangerous to one’s health. In the Yerushalmi, the statement of R. Yoḥanan answers the question raised: R. Jonah might add water to his wine as long as his cup was not of metal.. Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: The first generations asked whether the left hand may help the right hand with the cup used for reciting Grace. You may infer from this three things. You infer that one must hold the cup with his right hand, that one’s hand must be lifted from the table at least a hand-breadth, and that one has to look at the cup. Rebbi Aḥa said: Three things were said about the cup of Grace: full, decorated, and washed. All three come from one verse ( 33:23): “Naphtali is satiated with goodwill, full of the blessings of the Eternal.” Satiated - decorated, goodwill - washed, full as its acception. Rebbi Ḥanina said, if you did so, what is written there: “West and South his inheritance,” you merit to inherit this world and the world to come. Rebbi Eleazar said: One does not recite benedictions on a damaged cup. If one tasted from it, he damaged it. You may infer from this three things. You infer that one does not recite benedictions on a damaged cup. And that it must contain a measure. And if one tasted from it, he damaged it a quarter ) to be valid. In the Babli ( 105b/106 a), the derivation is both from the argument given here and from a about after the Sabbath. The parallel argument would have been to derive the necessity of a minimal volume of wine from the next paragraph which implies that if one does not have enough wine for both Friday night and Sabbath morning one leaves all the wine for the morning. Otherwise, one simply could divide the wine and drink the volume of a liquor glass each time. The order of topics here does not exclude that this also is the Yerushalmi reasoning.. Rebbi Tanḥum bar Yudan said: The honor of the day takes precedence over the honor of the night. The of the night takes precedence over the of the day. What is the honor of the day? Rebbi Yosi in the name of Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, and Rebbi Eleazar bar Joseph in the name of Rav: “He Who created the fruit of the vine. is in the night. The obligation of honoring the Sabbath is mainly during the day. Hence, if there is only one cup of wine, of the night should be recited over bread. The of the day, referred to in the Babli euphemistically as “great ,” consists in reciting the benediction over wine only, without any additions, over a specially dedicated cup of wine. This is reported and endorsed in the Babli ( 106a) as the action “of an old man,” confirming a Yerushalmi practice.” Rebbi Zeriqan, son of the father-in-law of Rebbi Zeriqan, mentioned Ḥanukkah in “the Land” and they praised him in Halakhah 5 that Ḥanukkah should be mentioned. Here, the place of the mention is fixed in the second benediction of Grace. The Babli ( 24a) concurs, but notes that the mention is not obligatory.. Rebbi Abba, son of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, mentioned “the true Judge 46b) quotes a in the name of Rebbi Aqiba which seems to imply that in a house of mourning the benediction “He Who is good” is replaced by “the True Judge”; the Talmud then reinterprets the to mean that “the True Judge” is inserted in “He Who is good.” The Yerushalmi here gives a date for the re-interpretation.” in “He Who is good and does good” and they praised him. Rebbi Abba, son of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: If one eats walking, he stands still for Grace. If one eats standing, he sits down for Grace. If one eats sitting, he reclines but is rejected. There it is declared that one always recites Grace sitting upright. There as here, this is the end of the Chapter; one has to see in the Babli an intentional answer to the Yerushalmi. for Grace. If one eats reclining, he wraps himself in his toga with for Grace. If one acts in this fashion, he is like an Angel of Service. What is the reason? ( 6:2) “With two [wings] he would cover his face, and with two [wings] he would cover his feet.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: These are the matters between the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel about meals. The House of Shammai say, one pronounces the benediction of the day of Friday night and holidays that has to precede the meal. and then the one over wine. But the House of Hillel say, one pronounces the benediction over wine and aftewards the one of the day. HALAKHAH: What 10:2 (with a slightly better text). The content of this paragraph is paralleled in Babli 51b and, in language very close to the Babli, in Tosephta 5:25. Both Babli and Tosephta add that “practice follows the House of Hillel,” a seemingly unnecessary statement since practice always follows the House of Hillel (except if noted otherwise.) It seems that the Tosephta is very old, from before the times of Rabban Gamliel. The Yerushalmi either suppressed the note that was no longer relevant or quotes another source which never had that statement. is the reason of the House of Shammai? The Sanctification of the Day causes the wine to be served; he was obligated for the Sanctification of the Day 20:8): “Remember the Sabbath Day to declare it holy” and this obligation starts immediately at nightfall, whereas the meal is held later for technical reasons. The laws of are discussed in Chapter 10 of and reviewed in the author’s pp. 209–227. before the wine was served. What is the reason of the House of Hillel? The wine causes the Sanctification of the Day to be recited may also be recited over the Sabbath bread but this is not the preferred way, at least not in the Land of Israel where wine was and is abundant.). Another explanation: The wine is frequent, Sanctification is less frequent 2:3, 8:6, 5:6. 4:5. The principle is implied by the Yerushalmi here. Both Houses have two reasons for their positions. Wine is more frequent since it is also used during weekdays and it may also be used for . Rebbi Yose said: From the words of both of them it follows that for wine and starts at the very moment of nightfall., the wine comes first. Is not the reason of the House of Shammai that the Sanctification of the Day causes the wine to be served? But here, does not cause the wine to be served may be recited over any alcoholic beverage (in the opinion of the Babli, over any beverage, other than water, that is common in the country.) may be recited only over wine or possibly the Sabbath bread.; wine therefore has precedence. Is not the reason of the House of Hillel that the wine is frequent, Sanctification of the Day is less frequent? Also here, wine is frequent and is less frequent: the wine has precedence. Rebbi Mana said: From the words of both of them it follows that for wine and , comes first. Is not the reason of the House of Shammai that he was obligated for the Sanctification of the Day before the wine came? Also here, since he is obligated for before the wine came, has precedence. Is not the reason of the House of Hillel that the wine causes the Sanctification of the Day to be recited? But here, the wine does not cause to be recited: has precedence may be recited over any alcoholic beverage (in the opinion of the Babli, over any beverage, other than water, that is common in the country.) may be recited only over wine or possibly the Sabbath bread.. Rebbi Zeïra said: One infers from the words of both of them that one may make without wine but one may not make without wine 106b) allows one to make over bread, at least in Babylonia where wine is hard to come by.. That is the opinion of Rebbi Zeïra since Rebbi Zeïra said: One makes on alcoholic beverages107a), but the practice there is spelled out that any alcoholic beverage common in a country may be used for Current practice allows even non-alcoholic beverages, except water, as long as they are commonly used ( 296(2)). but one goes from one place recited over wine has precedence. to another to hear The Great Rebbi Yose said: Over there, they have the custom that at a place without wine, the reader stands before the Ark Normally, evening prayers are communal without a reader., recites one benediction that contains seven: “(1) Shield of the Patriarch, (2) He Who revives the dead by His command, (3) the Holy God, (4) Who gives rest to His people, (5) before Him we shall serve (6) and give thanks to His name, God of thanksgiving, (7) Master of peace.” Today, the benediction is recited always except the first night of Passover when everybody is required to drink four cups of wine; thus, there is no reason to replace by public prayer. In Babylonian sources, the benediction is not mentioned explicitly; in Medieval sources, a different reason is given for the benediction., and closes by “He Who sanctifies Israel and the Sabbath Day.” It is difficult in the opinion of the House of Shammai, how to proceed on Friday evening if someone was sitting and eating on Friday afternoon, it got dark, and there was only one cup of wine 1:2) but one may start earlier and continue until nightfall. The Talmud (Babli 100a, Yerushalmi 10:1, fol. 37b) reports that R. Yehudah bar Illai requires one to stop before nightfall, but R. Yose bar Ḥalaphta lets him continue, and practice follows R. Yose. It is assumed here that even the House of Shammai will accept the position of R. Yose.? You must say that he reserves the cup until after the recitation of Grace and includes all other benedictions. Obviously, if he would want to pronounce the benediction for the day, Grace has precedence. If he wants to recite the benediction over wine, the day has precedence. One may infer this from the following ( 8:9): “If wine was brought to them after the meal and there was only one cup.” Rebbi Abba said: Because it is a very short benediction, he might forget and drink. But here, he connects everything with the cup of wine and he will not forget. How should he proceed according to the House of Shammai? He should recite Grace first, after that he makes and only after that he recites the benediction over the wine. It is difficult in the opinion of the House of Hillel, how may one proceed at the end of the Sabbath if someone was sitting and eating on Sabbath, it got dark, and there was only one cup of wine? You say, he reserves it until after the meal and connects everything to it. What can you say? Shall he recite the benediction for the wine, Grace has precedence. Shall he recite Grace, the light has precedence but with it a benediction for man-made fire (that was forbidden on the Sabbath and now can be kindled anew) and spices (to make up for the loss of the intensified pleasure one derives from the Sabbath that now is being lost.) The invention of man-made fire is traditionally attributed to Adam at the end of his first Sabbath, see Halakhah 6. The problem here is that one must make the benediction for the light as soon as one profits from newly lit fire.. Shall he recite for the light, has precedence. We may infer from the following 5:30, Babli 52a. In both of these sources, the House of Shammai is reported to require light before spices and the House of Hillel spices before light. R. Arieh Leib Yellin in his points out that the text of the Yerushalmi is consistent with all the inferences drawn here and in Halakhah 5. Hence, there is a genuine difference in tradition between Galilee and Babylonia.: “Rebbi Yehudah said, the house of Shammai and the house of Hillel do not disagree that Grace comes first and at the end. They disagree only over light and spices because the House of Shammai say spices and afterwards light, but the house of Hillel say light and afterwards spices.” Rebbi Abba and Rav Jehudah: Practice follows him who says spices and afterwards light. What should he do following the opinion of the House of Hillel? He should say Grace first, afterwards he should recite the benediction over wine and afterwards A holiday that starts at the end of Sabbath. Rebbi Yoḥanan said YQNH, wine, , light, Ḥanan bar Abba said in the name of Rav: Wine, , light, , time101b).. Rebbi Ḥanina said, NHYQ wine, In the Babli ( 102a), this order is attributed to R. Joshua, the early highest authority who is given his full name, R. Joshua ben Ḥananiah. It is possible that this led to the substitution of “R. Joshua ben Levi” for “Samuel” in the following parable. However, Rashbam (R. Samuel ben Meïr), in his commentary to Babli quotes R. Ḥanina as requiring YNHQ, wine, light, But this is the undisputed order of Levi here who is described as taking a middle road between R. Ḥanina and R. Yoḥanan. The Venice print of the Yerushalmi has the impossible reading YNHYQ which is a confluence of the codes attributed to R. Ḥanina in the Babli and the Yerushalmi.. Samuel follows the opinion of Rebbi Ḥanina since Rebbi Aḥa said in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: A king for the holiday. Since holidays also give one spiritual ease, spices are not added at the end of a Sabbath that is the start of a holiday. leaves and a prefect comes. One accompanies the king and only afterwards does one receive the prefect. Levi said YNHQ; first the full and then an appended In the Babli (102a), Levi is reported as requiring QNYH, in opposition to everybody mentioned here.. It seems that Levi says it both ways before following R. Ḥanina.. Rebbi Zeïra asked before Rebbi Yose: What does one do in practice? He said to him: one follows Rav and Rebbi Yoḥanan. And so it became the practice following Rav and Rebbi Yoḥanan. When Rebbi Abbahu went to the South, he followed Rebbi Ḥanina. When he descended to Tiberias, he followed Rebbi Yoḥanan in order not to disagree with anybody in his home town. The opinion of Rebbi Ḥanina is understandable. It is difficult to understand Rebbi Yoḥanan: Does one not pronounce the benediction over the light at all other days that one should extinguish it The light for is preferably a torch, but the light for a meal is from a lamp.? And here, he makes the benediction over the light so that he should not extinguish it and should precede irrespective of the order of and [In current practice, the wife lights the candles first with her own benediction and the husband then recites his benediction (after ) over the same lights. That does not seem to be reasonable. It may be assumed that R. Ḥanina requires either husband or wife to recite the first benediction over light.]. How does Rebbi Yoḥanan handle this? Since he has wine, his light will not go out. Then he might say the benediction over the light at the end. In order not to disturb its timing from other Sabbaths as a matter of course..",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: The House of Shammai say that one washes his hands and after that he mixes the cup, but the House of Hillel say that one mixes the cup first and then he washes his hands cup. is followed by a meal with bread for which one must wash his hands. The details and reasons are spelled out in the Halakhah. This disagreement has nothing to do with the question whether one washes his hands before (following R. Moses Isserls) or after (following R. Joseph Caro) ; in both cases, the cup is filled before one washes his hands.. HALAKHAH: What is the reason of the House of Shammai? The fluids on the back of the cup should not become impure from his hands and in their turn defile the cup A Biblical source of impurity is called אב הטוּמאה “father of impurity”. The only possible objects of impurity are humans, vessels, and food. Any object that becomes impure secondarily, usually by contact, is “first in impurity.” For profane objects, the two stages are the only ones. However, by rabbinic tradition there exists a “second in impurity” for profane and “third, fourth” for certain holy objects. The general principle is that any transmitted impurity decreases by one degree. There is one important exception. Since body fluids of a person with gonorrhea are “fathers of impurity”, it was decreed that any impurity involving fluids is at least “first in impurity.” Also, unwashed hands are always assumed to be “second in impurity.” If one touches a dry cup with unwashed hands, nothing happens. But if there should be drops of wine on the outside of the cup, these drops will become “first in impurity” and defile the contents of the cup. It is the characteristic of Rabbinic (pharisaic) Judaism that one tries to eat one’s profane meals in a way reasonably consistent with rules of ritual purity. It seems that the House of Shammai assumes that a “full cup” required for is full to the rim, kept together only by surface tension, and, hence, it is unlikely that the back of the cup will be dry. (For pottery vessels, other rules apply.) The text of the explanation is from the Tosephta ( 5:26).. What is the reason of the House of Hillel? The back of the cup is always impure. Another explanation: Washing of the hands should be as close as possible to the benediction (R. Moshe Isserls). Here also both explanations are from the Tosephta (). Rebbi Vivan in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: It turns out that the House of Shammai is consistent with Rebbi Yose and the House of Hillel with Rebbi Meïr, since we have stated there (Mishnah 25:7)3:9–10: “R. Meïr said: How is it for impure hands? If one’s hands are impure, the outside of the cup is pure; if it has moist spots then he may hold the cup by its rim without worry. R. Yose said: How is it for pure hands? If his hands were pure and moist, but the outside of the cup impure, then he may hold the cup at the rim without worrying that the moisture of his hand should become impure from the outside and then defile his hand.” It follows that for R. Yose, the hands have to be pure (i. e., washed) and for R. Meïr they may be impure.: “Rebbi Meïr said, for impure and pure hands. Rebbi Yose said, they spoke only about pure hands.” Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Sabbatai and Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: For is the gift for the Cohen from newly kneaded dough. It has the status of holiness of ; hence, it has to be separated from the dough in purity which, in all cases, means also that in the Land of Israel one has to wash his hands before taking it. (All other countries are impure anyhow and their must be burned.) and for washing one’s hands, he has to walk then the Babli declares in the name of the Galilean sages that one should clean his hands with sand or any other cleaning material. up to four Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina: That is, going forward; but one does not bother him to return on his way. How does one treat watchmen in gardens and orchards, as before them, as after them in search of water or may they clean their hands with sand or other cleansers?? Let us hear it from this (Mishnah 2:3): “A woman may sit down naked and separate her needs a benediction, it may not be done if one’s genitals are visible. A woman may hide her genitals by sitting down but a man cannot do that. because she can cover herself, but a man may not.” Is that woman not sitting inside her house and you say that one does not bother her? Also here, one does not bother him. It has been stated 5:13. Since the Mishnah introduces laws of washing one’s hands, the details are discussed from here on.: “Water before the meal is conditional 5 (5694), pp. 97–110]. The same language is found in the Tosephta, in 15, and in other Galilean Midrashim. The explains the expression “conditional” for something that is required, by “it is optional in the sense that if one decides not to eat bread with his meal, he does not have to wash his hands.”, after the meal it is obligatory. Only that for the first one he takes and interrupts2:1–3 that rules, if one washed his hands with less than a of water for each hand then he has to wash each hand twice. However, in that case it is not true that one may interrupt the washing because if he does not keep his mind concentrated on watching his hands they become impure again. As S. Lieberman points out, one might follow the interpretation of R. Isaiah I of Trani ( on 52a) that the Yerushalmi here stays with the previous topic of and speaks of washing one’s hands twice, once for for cleanliness and after that for food for ritual purity. This agrees with Tosephta 4:8, which requires the washing of one hand for the wine drunk as appetizer before a formal dinner.; for the second he takes and may not interrupt.” What is: “He takes and interrupts”? Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, he takes and repeats. Rebbi Samuel bar Isaac said it reads: “Rebbi bar Isaac asked: …” This language is somewhat easier but the reading R. bar Isaac is better; since it refers to an Amora also otherwise known, there is no reason to cross out the word “said” here. In the Rome ms., the reading is: רבי שמואל בר יצחק את מימר דבעי ואת אמרת רשות “R. Samuel bar Isaac: You say that it is needed and you say that it is conditional?”, I asked: “He takes and interrupts” and you say it is conditional? Rebbi Jacob bar Idi said: Because of the first 106a, the opinion of “some say” is ascribed there to Ravin (Rebbi Abin). The full story is in 24 [quoted also in 15, 2(20)]: In a time of persecution, when one could not show one’s Jewishness openly, a shopkeeper had both kosher and non-kosher food prepared. Since he could not ask his customers whether they were Jewish, he gave the kosher food to people who washed before eating bread and pig’s meat to customers who did not wash. When a man came in who did not wash his hands, he was taken for a Gentile and served non-kosher food. [For halakhic consequences of this story, see 178, Note #4 of ], pork was eaten. Because of the second 83b of a man who unlawfully kept a money-pouch that was deposited with him. He did not wash his hands, so the victimized person saw that he had eaten peas, went to the wife of the thief and told her that her husband wanted her to give him the pouch and as sign of recognition he told him to tell her that their last meal was peas. The wife then gave him back the money pouch. When the husband came back, he was so incensed that he killed his wife. It seems that the Yerushalmi has a first version in which the husband simply divorced his wife and in the second version he killed his wife, the intended victim, and himself. In the Yerushalmi source, quoted above, the husband was not a thief, but he was the victim of a man who tricked the wife out of a precious ring by the identification of the food of his last meal., a woman had to leave her house; some say, three persons were killed. Samuel went to visit Rav and saw him eating with his hands covered by cloth. He asked him, what is that to the next water source. The parallel in the Babli is 107a.? He answered him, I am asthenic. When Rebbi Zeïra immigrated here, he saw Cohanim eating with their hands covered by cloth. He told them, was not that of Rav and Samuel explained away? Rebbi Yose bar bar Cahana 107a/b), the name is Rav Taḥlifa bar Abime, a known student of Samuel. came in the name of Samuel: Handwashing is for profane food,” he must wash his hands. While this washing is taken from the discipline of , one opinion allows Cohanim to eat without washing but wearing gloves since a Cohen knows that eating impure is a deadly sin, so he will avoid any contact between his hands and the food. But for profane food where washing is simply a matter of discipline (although taken from the rules of ) it cannot be circumvented, cf. Babli 106a., not for Rebbi Yose says, for and for profane food. Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, and Rebbi Jonah, and Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi in the name of Rav: Handwashing for is to the wrist but for profane food it is to the finger joints. Maisha, the grandson of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said: If someone wanted to eat with my grandfather and he did not rinse his hands to the wrist, he would not eat with him106a/b. Since R. Joshua ben Levi is a higher authority than Rav, practice in both Talmudim requires washing to the wrist also for profane food. The identification of פרק as wrist and קשרי אצבעות as the joint of fingers to the hand follows (R. Eliezer ben Joel Halevi), not Rashi and Tosaphot in their commentaries on the Babli.. Rav Huna said: Handwashing is only for bread. Rebbi Hoshaya stated: For anything getting dirty by a fluid 115a to explain why at the ceremony one has to wash his hands before touching the vegetable that is to be dipped in fluid. For any sacred food like or the Passover sacrifice, it is obvious that one has to wash his hands before touching fluids since the secondary impurity of hands causes primary impurity for the fluid. Hence, for the it is only a question whether one should pronounce a benediction, as in the times of the Temple, or whether one washes his hands as a remembrance of Temple times. Here, the question is posed for everyday food, since handwashing for profane food comes from the “discipline of ” Rav is of the opinion that the Rabbinic institution of handwashing applies only to bread whereas Rebbi Hoshaya requires handwashing for profane food in all situations where it would be required for In Antiquity, in the absence of spoons most foods in sauce were scooped up with pitta bread. Hence, the real difference between Rav and R. Hoshaya was in food handling as explained by R. Zeïra.. Rebbi Zeïra said: Even when cutting lupines, he used to wash his hands. Rav 106b/107a), Rav is quoted as requiring an explicit declaration to make the washing of the hands valid for the entire day and Rebbi Avina seems to restrict this to desert-like conditions where water is not easily found. The latter interpretation is then rejected by the Talmud. In the Yerushalmi it seems that Rav is reported to require only one washing per day and Rebbi Avina restricts it to people like donkey drivers who cannot easily find water. Since he is the Israeli authority, it may be presumed that the Yerushalmi prefers the interpretation that is rejected in the Babli. said: If one washed his hands in the morning, one does not bother him in the evening. Rebbi Avina commanded the donkey drivers: If you find water to wash, wash your hands and condition them for the entire day. Rebbi Zeïra went up to Rebbi Abbahu in Caesarea. When he met him he said: Come to eat. He [R. Abbahu] gave him a loaf to break and told him: Take it and recite the benediction. He [R. Zeïra] said to him: The householder knows best the qualities of his loaf. After they had eaten, he [R. Abbahu] said to him: Start and recite Grace. He [R. Zeïra] said to him: The rabbi knows Rav Huna who is a great man and he used to say that he who starts is the one who finishes 46a. There, the Babli adds that practice follows R. Joḥanan (in the name of R. Simeon bar Yoḥai) who declares that the head of the household should recite the benediction for the bread since he is the host but that the guest should recite Grace and add to it a public blessing for the host. Even though the two authors quoted are Israeli, it follows from the Yerushalmi here that the public blessing for the host was never accepted practice in Galilee.. A disagrees with Rav Huna, as it was stated 5:6 and a different one in Babli 46b. It seems that the three texts represent three different traditions.: “The order of washing of the hands 4:11: “In doubtful cases involving hands to become impure, to transmit impurity, or to be pure, they are declared pure.” Hence, since the House of Shammai agree that the entire matter is one of doubt, there is no problem since the hands of the person eating remain pure.. Up to five persons, one starts with the most important personality. More than that, one starts with the least important one. In the middle of the meal one starts with the most important one 105a/b) quotes a that declares washing of hands in the middle of the meal (between courses) to be voluntary; the exact halakhic meaning of this statement is in doubt.. After the meal one starts with him who will recite Grace.” Does that not mean that he may prepare himself for reciting Grace? If you say that the one who starts is the one who finishes, he already is prepared! Rebbi Isaac said, explain it for those who come separately and do not know who will recite Grace.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: The House of Shammai say, one dries his hands with a towel and puts the latter on the table; the House of Hillel say, on the pillow. HALAKHAH: The Mishnah deals with a table of marble or one of parts screwed together that cannot become impure 1:10) even states that a wooden table that contains a frame into which a marble table top is put cannot become impure since wooden implements become impure only if they enclose a volume and in this case the frame is filled with material that cannot become impure. The table whose legs are screwed in and can be unscrewed without tools is covered by the Tosephta ( 1:11): “Restaurant chairs, even those having holes, that have their legs screwed in are permanently pure; if legs are fixed with a nail then they may become impure.” The parallel in the Babli (52b) states that the House of Shammai will forbid the use of a table that is ritually unclean; both Babli and Tosephta (5:27) note that the House of Hillel will never allow one to put the towel on the table because the fluid on the towel might touch the food and render it impure in the second degree (and by eating from it an amount greater than the volume of two eggs one’s body becomes impure in the second degree, Mishnah 2:2). The arguments of the Babli are incompatible with those of the Yerushalmi.. What is the reason of the House of Shammai? That the fluids on the towel should not become impure from the pillow and in turn defile his hands. What is the reason of the House of Hillel? In case of doubt, fluids and hands are considered pure 4:11: “In doubtful cases involving hands to become impure, to transmit impurity, or to be pure, they are declared pure.” Hence, since the House of Shammai agree that the entire matter is one of doubt, there is no problem since the hands of the person eating remain pure.. Another explanation: “Hands” are not for profane food” Hence, there is no reason to follow strict rules in case of doubt since it is a principle that doubts regarding Rabbinic institutions must be resolved leniently.. Do the House of Shammai hold that “hands” are for profane food? Explain it either following Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar or following Rebbi Eleazar, son of Rebbi Ẓadoq. Following Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar as it has been stated 1:6 in the reading of Rabbenu Simson of Sens. In the printed editions and the Vienna manuscript, the reading is “hands are of primary impurity for sacrifices.” That reading is rejected by R. David Pardo in his commentary on the Tosephta. The statement is quoted several times in the Yerushalmi and also in Babli 33b. The interpretation here is that profane food can become impure only from the source of impurity or primary impurity. Hence, unwashed hands must be of primary impurity in order to influence profane food. In contrast, becomes unusable if it was in contact with secondary impurity; hence, primary impurity causes the same result for profane food as secondary impurity for This seems to be the opinion of Maimonides (הלכוֹת אבוֹת הטוּמאה יא׃טו), who often is influenced by the Yerushalmi, also in ; it is incompatible with Rashi’s interpretation of the text in There it is stated that hands can become primarily impure only if held into the windows of a house afflicted with leprosy. That would not make a good reason for the House of Shammai.: “Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar said in the name of Rebbi Meïr, hands are primarily impure for profane food and secondarily for ” Or following Rebbi Eleazar, son of Rebbi Ẓadoq, as we have stated there 2:8, quoted in Babli 20a, 35b. Profane food can receive only primary impurity. can receive both primary and secondary impurity; the third stage is called “unusable” since it cannot be eaten, but it does not transmit the impurity further. Sacrifices become impure also in a tertiary way; only the fourth stage is “unusable.”: “Profane food that was prepared under the rules of purity of sacrifices is still profane food. Rebbi Eleazar, the son of Rebbi Ẓadoq said, it is like becoming impure in two stages and unusable in a third.” There (Mishnah 4:6) we have stated: “Someone who rubbed himself with pure oil, then he became impure, he descended for purification. and immersed himself. The House of Shammai say, he is pure even if it drips, but the House of Hillel say impure cannot touch his skin where it is covered by oil.. But if the oil was impure to start out with, the House of Shammai say, up to the anointing of a small limb 8:1, Babli 77a) agree that “a small limb” is a small limb of a newborn. This is the maximum amount that can become pure by immersion of one’s body.; but the House of Hillel say, moist fluid. Rebbi Yehudah says in the name of the House of Hillel, moist and making moist.” The opinions of the House of Hillel are reversed! There they say “impure” and here they say “pure.” There it is visible, here it is absorbed in the towel.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: The House of Shammai say: Light, Grace, spices and is required in addition to Grace.. But the House of Hillel say, Light, spices, Grace, and The House of Shammai say: “He Who created illumination by fire.” But the House of Hillel say, “He Who is creating illuminations by fire. 54a) is called “divine inspiration.”” HALAKHAH: It was stated: “Rebbi Yehudah said, the house of Shammai and the house of Hillel did not disagree that Grace comes first and at the end. They disagree only over light and spices because the House of Shammai say spices and afterwards light, but the house of Hillel say light and afterwards spices.” Rebbi Abba and Rav Yehudah: Practice follows him who says spices and afterwards light. The 5:29, Babli 43b. The text of the Tosephta manuscripts is close to the Yerushalmi. In the Babli and the traditional printed text of the Tosephta, the rôles of the Houses of Shammai and Hillel are reversed. The Babli starts: “When they brought to them oil and wine …” meaning that it was brought in the middle of the dinner for enjoyment. This is the opinion of R. Abraham ben David. According to Maimonides ( 7:14), wine and spiced oil were brought after dinner, to recite Grace over them. According to Rashi, this wine was brought after Grace had already been recited. House of Shammai say, the cup in his right hand and perfumed oil in his left hand; first he says the benediction over the cup and then over the perfumed oil. The House of Hillel say, perfumed oil in his right hand and the cup in his left hand, he recites the benediction over the perfumed oil and rubs it on the head of the waiter. But if the waiter was learned, he would rub it on the wall because it does no credit to the learned to walk around perfumed. Abba 1089(8); there the names are Rebbi Abba and Rav Ḥuna. This is more reasonable, but there the names do not fit either since it says that Rav Huna insulted Rebbi Zeïra and Rebbi Abba told him to get up and serve. This is totally impossible since both Rebbis Abba and Zeïra were students of Rav Huna. On the other hand, the reading אבוי “his father” is impossible in the Yerushalmi since R. Abba bar bar Ḥana’s full name was R. Abba bar R. Abba bar Ḥana, which shows that he was a posthumous child and his father could not get angry with him. The most reasonable scenario is that R. Abba insulted the much younger R. Zeïra and R. Huna ordered them to switch places; but this has no manuscript evidence. bar bar Ḥana and Rav Ḥuna were sitting down and eating and Rebbi Zeïra was standing and serving them. He came and carried both in one hand. Abba bar bar Ḥana said to him: Is your other hand cut off? His father got angry with him and said to him: “Is it not enough for you that you are reclining and he stands and serves? But in addition, he is a Cohen and you make fun of him when Samuel said that he who uses a Cohen commits larceny the particular larceny committed in using Temple property for profane ends ( 5:14–16).. I order that he should recline and you get up and serve in his stead.” From where that he who uses a Cohen commits larceny? Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Samuel said ( 8:28): “I said to them, you are holy and the vessels are holy.” Since one who uses the Temple vessels commits larceny, also one who uses a Cohen commits larceny! According to the opinion of the House of Shammai, should one not say: “He Who created the fruit of the vine?” According to the opinion of the House of Hillel, one should say: “Creator of the fruit of the vine.” Wine is new every year; fire is not different every hour. Fire and hybrids were not created in the six days of Creation but they were in the Divine plan of the six days of Creation 5:31, as reason for the benediction over fire as will be explained later. In the Tosephta, R. Yose disagrees and says the fire of hell was created on the Second Day; in the opinion of the Babli ( 54a) hell and its fire precede the Creation. The Yerushalmi takes no position on this. The text of this and the following two sections are also in 82(17); there is a parallel in Babli 54a. As is normal in the Talmudim, a proposition of subjects A B is discussed in order B A.. Hybrids (36:24): “These are the sons of Ẓiv‘on, Ayyah and Anah. He is the Anah who invented the in the prairie.” What is ? Rebbi Yehudah ben Simon said ἡμίονος (“Half she-ass, mule”) and the rabbis say ἥμισυς (“half”), half horse and half donkey. These 8:3. The reading “R. Jonah” is from the Venice print in the Rome manuscript here, and There is no Amora who is called Rebbi Jehudah (reading of the Venice print and Leyden ms.) without mention of his father’s name. In the Babli (79a), the criterion is ascribed to Rav Papa, fifth generation Babylonian Amora. are its signs: Rebbi Jonah says, if it has small ears, its mother is a horse and its father a donkey. If they are large, its mother is a donkey and its father a horse. Rebbi Mana ordered those of the patriarch’s estate: If you want to buy a mule, “mule”., you should buy one with small ears whose mother is a horse and whose father is a donkey. What did has only \"Anah\" and is in the singular throughout, but here it starts with two persons but then in the middle of God's speech switches from plural to singular. One has to assume that there were two texts, one dealing only with Anah and the other with Ziv'on and Anah and that our text here is a confluence of both of them. Ẓiv‘on and Anah do? He prepared a female donkey and mated her with a male horse; a mule came out from them. The Holy One, praise to Him, said to them: You brought into the world a harmful thing, I shall bring over that man something that will harm him. What did the Holy One, praise to Him, do? He prepared a snake and mated her with a Ḥardaun; a brightly colored snake came out of them. Nobody will ever tell you that he was bitten by a brightly colored snake and survived, bitten by a rabid dog and survived, hit by a mule and survived (but only by a white female mule 7b) adds that the only mule that kills with its hoof is a white one even whose hoofs are white..) R. Levi in the name of Bar Nazira: Thirty-six hours did Man enjoy the light that was created on the First Day of Creation 12a). Psalm 139 is ascribed to David in the Book of Psalms, but in all of talmudic literature it is taken to describe the experiences of Adam., twelve on Friday, twelve in the night of Sabbath, and twelve during the day of Sabbath; in this light Adam saw from one end of the world to the other. In this unending light, the entire Creation started singing God’s praise as it is said ( 37:2), “All under the heavens sing to Him, His light is on the corners of the world.” When the Sabbath ended, darkness came. Adam was afraid that this was what was said ( 3:15): “You will crush its head and it will crush your heel;” certainly it will crush me, so he said (139:11), “But the darkness will crush me.” R. Levi said: At this moment the Holy One, praised be He, let him find two flintstones that he knocked against each other 54a), the discovery of man-made fire is called “a heavenly inspiration.” and made fire; that is what is said ( 139:11), “Now the night is light for me,” and he praised the Creator of the illuminating fire. Samuel says: Therefore we give praise for the [man-made] fire at the end of Sabbath because that was the time of its first production. Rav Huna in the name of Rav, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: At the end of Yom Kippur one also recites the benediction since the light had rested all that day long), one does not recite the benediction over fire..",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: One does not recite a benediction over a lamp and spices of Gentiles, or over lamp and spices for the dead, or over lamp and spices set before an idol. Also, one does not recite the benediction over a lamp unless he has profited from its light. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Jacob stated before Rebbi Jeremiah: One recites a benediction over spices of Gentiles. How can he disagree? Uphold it for someone who burns spices in front of his store. One may make the benediction over a lantern even if it did not go out.. A lamp in his bosom or in a lantern or in glass “transparence; window panes, window (adj., plur. n.)”. This term is missing in the Tosephta (5:31) and the parallel in the Babli (53b)., if he sees the flame and does not use its light, or uses the light but does not see the flame, one never recites the benediction until one sees the flame and uses the light. Five 4:7. There is a similar in Babli 29a but it has no reference to things were said about burning charcoal and five about the flame. One commits larceny with the burning charcoal of the Temple; one may not use its flame but one cannot commit larceny with the latter 29a) declares the prohibition of its use as Rabbinic decree. The following cases all derive from the same principle.. Burning charcoal of idolatry is forbidden, its flame is allowed. He who makes a vow not to use anything of another person may not use his burning charcoal but is allowed his flame. He who carries out burning charcoal into the public domain 29a) discusses how one could possibly move the flame without the underlying coal. is guilty but for the flame he is free of punishment. One makes the benediction over the flame but not over glowing charcoal. Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi in the name of Rav which specifies explicitly that glowing but not crackling coals are not to be used for the benediction. [The title “Rebbi” in the text is again a scribal error.]: If the charcoal was crackling one makes the benediction. Rebbi Yoḥanan from Karẓion in the name of Rebbi Naḥum bar Simai: Only if [the flame] is jumping off. It was stated “A Gentile who lit from a Jew and a Jew who lit from a Gentile. 5:31. The text continues: “One recites the benediction.” In the Babli (53a) there is a that combines the two formulations of the Yerushalmi.” One understands a Gentile who lit from a Jew, but then even a Gentile who lit from a Gentile? It was found that it was stated: “One does not recite the benediction if a Gentile [lit] from a Gentile.” Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: A dead end street of Gentiles and one Jew lives in it, if light comes from there one recites the benediction because of the one Jew who is there. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: One does not recite the benediction on the spices but about the benediction that is required for the enjoyment of perfume. In the Babli (53a), R. Joḥanan is more explicit and says that these perfumes are burned to disinfect clothes; hence, they are not produced for human enjoyment. of Friday afternoon in Tiberias, nor on the spices of Sabbath night of Sepphoris, nor on light and spices of Friday Eve in Sepphoris, because they are for other purposes. “Nor over lamp and spices for the dead.” Rebbi Ḥizqiah and Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Yose, son of Rebbi Ḥanina: That is, if they are put at the head of the bier. But if they are put in front of the bier one may recite the benediction; I say they are put there for the honor of the living. “Nor over lamp and spices set before an idol.” Is not that of Gentiles identical with that of idolatry? Explain it with the idol of a Jew. “Also, one does not recite the benediction over a lamp unless one has profited from its light.” Rebbi Zeïra, the son of Rebbi Abbahu, preached: ( 1:4) “God saw the light that it was good” and after that, “God separated between the light and the darkness. one should not make until he saw the light and that it is useful. The same paragraph is found in 3(7) in slightly more explicit language.”. Rebbi Berekhiah said: The following was preached by the two greats of the world, Rebbi Yoḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: “God separated,” a true separation. Rebbi Yehudah, the son of Rebbi Simon, said: He separated it for Himself. But the rabbis say, He separated it for the just in the future world. They gave a parable, to what can this situation be compared? To a king who had two generals; both of them said: “I want to command during the day.” He called the first one and told him: day shall be your domain. He called the second one and told him: night shall be your domain. That is what is written: ( 1:5) “God called the light ‘day’, etc.” To the light he said: day shall be your domain; but to the darkness he said: night shall be your domain. Rebbi Yoḥanan said, that it is which the Holy One, praise to Him, said to Job: ( 38:12) “Did you ever command the morning, did you inform the morning of its place?” Do you know the place where the light of the Six Days of Creation was hidden? Rebbi Tanḥuma said: I shall give its reason. ( 45:7) “He Who fashioned the light and created darkness, He makes peace.” When it left: “From the moment that they were created, He is making peace.”, it made peace between them. “One does not recite the benediction over a lamp unless one has profited from its light.” Rav says , and Samuel says (’) and (‘) (and ); they re-acquired the differences only later under the influence of Arabic. Similarly, under the influence of Greek, in the speech of most Galileans also and had become silent. Since the Mishnah was transmitted orally, there was no difference in pronunciation between the two silent consonants and the interpretation of the words depended on whether one was imagining one or the other. The particular case here is not discussed in the Babli. The examples from and are discussed following these Mishnayot in the Babli where at other places one also finds examples of a silent ח (35b) and switches between ס (s) and צ (ss) ( 116b). In most cases, roots of Rabbinic expressions are sought in Biblical Hebrew.. He who says , ( 34:15) “But with this we shall be agreeable () to you.” He who says , ( 50:4) “To know, to inform (‘) the weary of wisdom.” There (Mishnah 5:1) we have stated: How does one complete cities? Rav says and Samuel says He who says one adds a limb (אבר) to it. And he who says like a pregnant (עוברה) woman. There (Mishnah 1:1) we have stated: Before the holidays of the Gentiles. Rav says and Samuel says He who says , ( 32:35) “For the day of their misfortune (אידם) is near.” He who says , (44:9) “They 2a), the interpretation of this verse takes up several pages. are their witnesses (עידיהם), may they neither see nor know, so that they may come to naught.” How does Samuel deal with Rav’s reason? They are their witnesses, in the future they will bring to naught their worshippers on the day of judgment. “One does not recite the benediction over a lamp unless he has profited from its light.” Rav Yehudah in the name of Samuel: So that women would be able to spin by its light. Rebbi Yoḥanan said: So that his eye should see what is in the cup or in the bowl. Rav Ḥinena said, so that he should be able to distinguish between two coins (1/24 ) and a (1/12 ); in the opinion of Ḥizqiah, one has to distinguish between local coins of the same weight and value but different mints. Since R. Ḥinena is the student of R. Yoḥanan, it seems that he is following Ulla’s opinion.. Rebbi Oshaia stated: Even if it was a banquet hall of ten by ten is a banquet hall in the Roman style, the “ten” probably are not Jewish cubits but Roman , of 4.5 feet each. Then the distance from a light kindled in one corner to the observer in the corner diagonally opposed would be about 67 feet; based on cubits it would be 48 feet, still a great distance in an otherwise dark room., one recites the benediction. Rebbi Zeïra went close to the light. His students told him: Why does our teacher make it so difficult for us, did not Rebbi Oshaya formulate: “even if it was a banquet hall of ten by ten, one recites the benediction?”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who ate, forgot, and did not recite Grace. The House of Shammai say, he should return to his place and recite. The House of Hillel say, he should recite at the place where he remembers it. How long may he recite? Until the food is digested in his bowels. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Justus bar Shunem said: Two Amoraïm, one proposed the reason of the House of Shammai and the other proposed the reason of the House of Hillel. He who proposed the reason of the House of Shammai: If he had forgotten there a wallet full of precious stones and pearls, would he not go back and retrieve his wallet? Here also, let him return to his place and recite Grace. He who proposed the reason of the House of Hillel: A worker who worked at the top of a date palm or at the bottom of a cistern, would one bother him to return and recite Grace? No, he should recite at the place where he remembers. So here also, he should recite at the place where he remembers and the argument of the House of Hillel precedes that of the House of Shammai. Hence, its implication is that the House of Shammai require the worker to return to his dangerous place and his employer to pay for the time lost. In this case, it seems that the Yerushalmi reports a deliberate change from earlier practice in order to embody a change in labor law.. How long may he recite? Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Samuel, until the food in his bowels is digested. But the sages say, all the time that he is thirsty because of that meal. Rebbi Yoḥanan says, until he gets hungry again, 1 hour 12 min., has no parallel in the Yerushalmi. The difference between the Galilean יתאכל and the Babylonian יתעכל is dialectal; the Babylonian Mishnah has יתעכל. Since Samuel was a medical doctor, his explanation “until the food was digested” may have been practical for him; it certainly is not practical for everybody else. It is therefore not necessary to say that R. Yoḥanan is more restrictive than the Mishnah (as is the opinion of the student of Rabbenu Jonah in his commentary on Alfassi.).",

Hence, one answers “Amen” after a Jew even though one did not hear. Did we not formulate: If he heard but did not answer, he did his duty. If he answered but did not hear, he did not do his duty.

Rebbi Zeïra inquired, what are beginnings of chapters? ( 113:1) “Hallelujah, praise, you servants of the Eternal, praise the name of the Eternal. or the first sentence of every Psalm to be recited; cf. Tosaphot 38b, מכאן.” They asked before Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, from where do we know that if somebody heard but did not answer, that he fulfilled his duty? He said, because we see great rabbis acting accordingly. They stand in the congregation where some say ( 118:26): “Blessed he who comes,” and the others say: “in the name of the Eternal,” and all have fulfilled their duty 38b) and is accepted in most Jewish groups.. Rebbi Oshaya stated: One answers “Amen” even if he did not eat, but he may not say: “Let us bless Him, of Whose bounty we ate,” except if he did eat. It is stated 3:27, also Babli 47a.: “One answers neither an orphan Amen, nor a plucked Amen, nor a hurried Amen. Ben Azai said, if one answered an orphan Amen, may his children be orphans; hurried, may the end of his days be hurried; plucked, may his soul be plucked off. For a long Amen, they lengthen his days and years in a good way.” What is an orphan Amen? Rav Huna said, that is one who sits to recite a blessing, he answers Amen, and is not conscious for what he answered Amen. It is stated: One answers Amen after a Gentile who recited a benediction for the Eternal, [but if he recited a benediction with the Name one does not answer 5:21). The correct interpretation seems to be that given by R. Saul Lieberman in : Since the Gentile is not subject to our rules, if he praises the Eternal, one answers after him Amen. But if he uses a Jewish formula, one may not answer after him Amen unless one has ascertained that he conformed with our rules..] Rebbi Tanḥuma said, if a Gentile blesses you, answer after him Amen since it is written ( 7:14) “You shall be blessed by all peoples.” A Gentile met Rebbi Joshua and blessed him. He answered: The word about you has already been said. He met a second one who cursed him; he answered: The word about you has already been said. His students said to him: Rebbi, did you say to the one what you said to the other? He said to them, so it is written ( 27:29): “Those who curse you are cursed, but those who bless you are blessed.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who sees a place where wonders were done for Israel, says: Praise to Him Who did wonders for our forefathers at this place. At a place from which paganism was uprooted, one says: Praise to Him Who uprooted paganism from our Land. HALAKHAH: The Mishnah deals with wonders of Israel (Margalit) notes that probably “Israel” here means “more than 50% of all of Israel” as in other circumstances.. But for wonders of a single person that happened to him, one does not have to recite a benediction. Does one have to recite a benediction for the wonders that were done for his father or his teacher? Or if he was a famous person like Joab ben Ẓeruiah and his companions? Or a man through whom the Name of Heaven was sanctified, for example Ḥananiah, Mishael, and Azariah [Rabbenu Asher ben Yeḥiel] has a different reading: “Does one have to recite a benediction for the wonders that were done for his father or his teacher? Or if he was a famous person like Joab ben Ẓeruiah and his companions? Or a man through whom the Name of Heaven was sanctified, for example Daniel and his companions? He recites a benediction.” In this version, all questions are being answered and the next sentence starts a new paragraph. also quotes from Rav Hai Gaon a reading in the Babli, referring to the previous paragraph, that for a miraculous escape a man, his son, and his grandson have to recite the (appropriate) benediction.? About wonders done for one of the tribes? According to him who said (Yerushalmi 1:6, fol. 46a; Babli 5b). The opposite opinion is that of Rebbi Meïr. that each tribe is called “assembly”, one has to recite the benediction; but according to him who said that only all tribes together are called “assembly”, one does not have to recite the benediction. He who sees Babylon has to recite five benedictions. If he sees the Euphrates, he says: “Praise to Him Who made the Creation.” If he sees a (statue of) Mercury, he says: “Praise to Him, Who is patient.” If he sees the house of Nabucadnezzar, he says: “Praise to Him, Who destroyed the house of that evil one.” If he sees the fiery oven or the lions’ den, he says: “Praise to Him, Who did wonders for our forefathers at this place.” If he sees a place from which one takes dust, he says: “Praise to Him, Who pronounces and does, decrees and upholds.” If one sees Babylon, he says ( 14:23): “I shall sweep her out with the broom of destruction.” Rebbi Zeïra and Rebbi Yehudah in the name of Rav: Any benediction without mention of the Kingdom is no benediction. Rebbi Tanḥuma said, I shall give the reason ( 145:1): “I shall elevate You, my God, o King!” Rav said, one has to say “You,” but Samuel said, one does not have to say “You.” Rebbi Yoḥanan and Rebbi Jonathan went to make peace in the Southern settlements. They came to a place where they found the reader saying. The parallel in the Babli (33b) is in the name of R. Ḥanina only who notes there that the three attributes we mention are only permitted because Moses used them in the Torah and the Men of the Great Assembly adopted them for prayer. In the Babli, R. Ḥanina let the reader finish and only afterwards asked him: Did you finish all that can be said about your Creator? This argument also is accepted by the Yerushalmi since the explanations of the verses that follow are based on the principle that God’s infinity cannot be expressed in finite words. In the Yerushalmi tradition, anyone who deviates from the pattern instituted by the Sages has to be stopped in the middle of his prayer.: “The great God, the strong and awe-inspiring, the noble and overpowering;” they stopped him and told him: you are not permitted to add to the formula the Sages coined for benedictions. Rav Huna in the name of Rav: ( 37:23) “The All-powerful, we did not find for Him the fullness of His might,” we did not find out the might and strength of the Holy One, praise to Him! Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: ( 37:20) “Can it be told to Him if I should speak, if a man tells, he certainly will be swallowed up.” If a man comes to tell the strengths of the Holy One, praise to Him, he sets himself up to be swallowed away from the world. Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman said ( 106:2) “Who can tell the strengths of the Eternal?” For example, I and my colleagues. Rebbi Abun said: “Who can ever tell the strengths of the Eternal?” Jacob 18a) he is called Rebbi Yehudah from Kefar Giboraia. His birthplace is a village North of Safed. He is mentioned as being in Tyre, where Rebbi Ḥaggai had him whipped because he proposed the principle of patrilineal descent for Jews [ 7(44), 7(3), 19]. of Kefar Naburaia explained in Tyre: ( 65:2) “Silence is praise for You, God in Zion!” The medicine for everything is silence; like a priceless jewel: everyone who adorns himself with it, diminishes it. It was stated 6:20; an older source dealing with a different set of circumstances; see the last note in this paragraph.: He who starts with YH and closes with YH is wise, with ’L, standing in for the unpronounceable YHWH, he uses “God”; he fails to specify God’s name. and closes with ’L is ignorant, with ’L and closes with YH is average, with YH and closes with ’L is not Jewish, he asserts that YHWH is a name common to a trinity. Hence, he is not Jewish but a Christian. This statement introduces the following discussions of Rebbi Simlai with Jewish Christians. [R. Saul Liebermann points out that the Tosephta may deal with a different period in Jewish history. In the Tosephta, the sequence ’L-’L is termed “not Jewish” and YH-’L as “ignorant.” He conjectures that the Tosephta is directed against sects similar to the Dead Sea sect in whose “Discipline of the community”, 1QS, one finds a formula: ברוך אתה אלי “Praise to You, my God (singular form).” (The prayer manual of the sect, 1QH, always uses the as replacement for YHWH.) In the time of the Yerushalmi, such sects no longer existed.]. (Jewish) Christians asked Rebbi Simlai: How many aspects of divinity created the world? He answered them: Are you asking me? Go and ask the first Adam, as it is said ( 4:32): “Please ask the first days etc.” It does not say there “when gods created man on the earth” but “from the day that God created man on the earth”. They said to him, but it is written ( 1:1): “In the beginning, created …” He said to them: Is it written “they created” (plural)? It says “he created” (singular). Rebbi Simlai said, every place where the Christians read heretic meanings is a genuine plural, not one of majesty., their answer is at that place. They came back and asked him: What is that which is written ( 1:26): “Let us make a human in our image, as in our pattern.” He answered them, it is not written: “ created man in their image” but ( 1:27): “God created man in His image.” His students told him: these you pushed away with a stick, what can you answer us? He said to them: Adam was created from dust, Eve was created from Adam. After Adam “in our image, like our pattern;” it is impossible for a man without a woman, or for a woman without a man, and for both of them without the 31a) this is formulated as: There are three partners in the creation of a child: Father, mother, and the Holy One, praise to Him (who gives soul and intelligence.). They came back and asked him: What is that which is written ( 22:22): “God, , Eternal, God, , Eternal, He knows.” He answered them, it is not written: “they know”, but “He knows.” His students told him: Teacher, these you pushed away with a stick, what can you answer us? He said to them: All three are one name, as if a man would say “King, Caesar, Augustus.” They came back and asked him: What is that which is written ( 50:2): “God, , Eternal, He spoke and called the earth.” He answered them, it is not written: “they spoke and called”, but “He spoke and called.” His students told him: Teacher, these you pushed away with a stick, what can you answer us? He said to them: All three are one name, as if a man would say “professional, builder, architect..” They came back and asked him: What is that which is written ( 24:19): “For He is a holy God.” He answered them, it is not written: “they”, but “He,” “He is a jealous God.” His students told him: Teacher, these you pushed away with a stick, what can you answer us? Rebbi Isaac said, He is holy in all kinds of holiness, as Rebbi Yudan said in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: The Holy One, praise to Him, is holy in all kinds of holiness. His speech is in holiness, His throning is in holiness, the baring of His arm is in holiness, God is awesome and majestic in holiness. His way is in holiness, ( 77:14) “God, Your way is in holiness.” His walking is in holiness, ( 68:25) “the course of my God, my King, in holiness.” His throning is in holiness, ( 47:9) “God throned on His holy throne.” His speech is in holiness, ( 60:8) “God spoke [in His holiness].” The baring of His arm is in holiness, ( 52:10) “The Eternal bared His holy arm.” He is awesome and glorious in holiness, ( 15:11) “Who is like You, glorious in holiness!” They, is mentioned in this sermon, one may take it as a proof that , which in the middle switches from a style identical to that of to extended sermons based on the starting verses of the weekly portions, does not necessarily have two different collectors or editors. came back and asked him: What is that which is written ( 4:8): “Where is a great people that has close to them?” He answered them, it is not written: “Like the Eternal, our , always when we call on them”, but “always when we call on Him.” His students told him: Teacher, these you pushed away with a stick, what can you answer us? He said to them, he is close in all kinds of closeness, as Rebbi Phineas said in the name of Rebbi Yehudah bar Simon: Idolatry seems close but is very far. What is the reason? ( 46:7) “They take it on the shoulder, carry it, etc.” Finally, his god is with him in the house and he cries until he dies but that one will not hear and not save him from his distress. But the Holy One, praise to Him, seems to be far away when there is no one closer than Him 68(8), 45(6), 90, 27, 16, 117, 563, 841]. The piece is a homily and not a theological essay., as Levi said: From the earth to the (first) heaven is a distance of 500 years’ walk. From one heaven to the next is a distance of 500 years’ walk. The thickness of each heaven is a distance of 500 years’ walk. And Rebbi Berekhiah and Rebbi Ḥelbo in the name of Red Rebbi Abba said, also the toes of the heavenly 1). are a length of 515 years’ walk, the number YŠRH. See how much higher He is than His world! But a person enters the synagogue, stands behind a pillar, prays in a whisper, and the Holy One, praise to Him, listens to his prayer, as it has been said ( 1:13): “Hannah spoke to herself, only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard.” But the Holy One, praise to Him, listened to her prayer. And so it is with all His creatures, as it has been said ( 102:1): “Prayer of the poor when he wraps himself up,” just like a man whispering into the ear of his friend and the latter understands. Can you have a God who is closer than that to His creatures, from mouth to ear?” Rebbi Yudan in the name of Rebbi Isaac said it in four versions. Flesh and blood has a protector, who was obliged to protect his .. When they tell him, your client was arrested, he will say: I will protect him. When they tell him, he is going before a court, he will say: I will protect him. When they tell him, he is taken to be hanged, where is he and where is his protector? But the Holy One, praise to Him, saved Moses from the sword of Pharao; that is what is written ( 18:4): “He saved me from the sword of Pharao.” Rebbi Yannai said 1(37)., it is written ( 2:15): “Moses fled from before Pharao.” Is it possible for flesh and blood to flee from the government? But at the moment when Pharao arrested Moses, he sentenced him to have him beheaded. The sword slipped off the neck of Moses and broke. That is what is written ( 7:5): “Your neck is like the ivory tower,” that is Moses’s neck. Rebbi. said, Rebbi Eviathar: Not only that, but He moved the sword from the neck of Moses on the neck of the executioner and killed him. That is what is written: “He saved me from the sword of Pharao.” He saved , but killed the executioner. Rebbi Berekhiah quoted on this ( 21:18) “The evil one is ransom for the just one.” Rebbi Abun quoted on this ( 11:8): “The just will be extricated from distress, the evil one will take his place.” Bar Qappara stated: An angel came down and appeared to them in the shape of Moses. They arrested the angel and Moses fled. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said: when Moses fled from before Pharao, all his troops became dumb, deaf, or blind. He asked the dumb, where is Moses? But they could not speak. He asked the deaf, they could not hear. He asked the blind, they could not see. That is what the Holy One, praise to Him, said to Moses ( 4:11): “Who gave man a mouth, or who makes dumb?” There it upheld you and here you do not want to uphold. That is what is written ( 4:8): “Who is like the Eternal, our , always when we call on Him!” Rebbi Yudan in the name of Rebbi Isaac said in another version: Flesh and blood has a protector. When they tell him, your client was arrested, he will say: I will protect him. When they tell him, he is going before a court, he will say: I will protect him. When they tell him, he is being thrown into the water, where is he and where is his protector? But the Holy One, praise to Him, saved Jonah from inside the fish, since it says ( 2:11): “The Eternal commanded the fish and it threw Jonah up.” Rebbi Yudan in the name of Rebbi Isaac in another version. Flesh and blood has a protector. When they tell him, your client was arrested, he will say: I will protect him. When they tell him, he is going before a court, he will say: I will protect him. When they tell him, he is being thrown into fire, where is he and where is his protector? But the Holy One, praise to Him, saved Ḥananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the fiery oven; this is what is written ( 3:14): “Nebucadnezzar declared and said, praised be the God of Shadrakh, Meshakh, and Abed Nego, etc.” Rebbi Yudan in the name of Rebbi Isaac said in another version: Flesh and blood has a protector, etc. until: he is being thrown to the wild beasts. But the Holy One, praise to Him, saved Daniel from the lions’ den. That is what is written ( 6:23): “My God sent his angel who closed the mouth of the lions, etc.” Rebbi Judan said in his own name (#537), the paragraph and the next one are quoted in a shortened form in the name of Rebbi Yehudah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah.: Flesh and blood has a protector. If someone is in trouble, he does not enter the protector’s place suddenly but rather stands at his door and calls his slave or familiar and that one will say: the man X is standing at the door of your courtyard. Maybe he will make him enter, maybe he will let him stand. But the Holy One, praise to Him, is not like this: If a human is in trouble, he should cry neither to Michael nor to Gabriel, rather he should cry to Me and I shall answer him immediately; that is what is written ( 3:5): “Every one who calls on the name of the Eternal will escape.” Rebbi Phineas said: It happened to Rav, the story is told of “some man.” This seems to be a more correct version, since Rav spent his time in the Yeshivah of Rebbi in Shephar‘am and Beth She‘arim in Western Galilee. Also, the setting fits much more the time of the military anarchy after the murder of Alexander Severus when Rav had long since returned to Babylonia. that he was ascending from the hot springs of Tiberias that he met Romans. They asked him, of whose party are you? He said, of Sophianus, the name is Popianus. The name is unidentifiable [could be Pompeianus (E. G.)]. [Z. Frankel wants to emend the name to (Septimius) Severus; but this identification is impossible for many reasons (it would require that Rav stayed at the Yeshiva of Rebbi at least 25 years, that Severus should have ever been in Galilee, and that in Galilee one spoke Hebrew with a German pronunciation that identified and and .)] The setting looks much more like that of a local conflict that was possible only during the military anarchy. The history of that period is not detailed enough to enumerate all local rulers. (There is a Roman surname Sophus.); they let him go. The next morning, they came to him and asked him, how long did you carry on with these Jews? He asked them, why? They said to him, we met a Jew and asked him, of whose party are you? He said, of Sophianus. He asked them, what did you do to him? They said to him, it was enough, we let him go. He said to them, you did well. And if a person who attaches himself on to the party of a human is saved, someone who attaches himself to the Holy One, praise to Him, so much more. That is what is written ( 3:5): “Every one who calls on the name of the Eternal will escape.” Rebbi Alexandri said, it happened that a prefect by the name of Alexander sat and judged a robber. He asked him, what is your name? Alexander! He said, Alexander, go to Alexandria. And if a person whose name is the name of a human is saved, someone whose name is that of the Holy One, praise to Him, so much more. That is what is written ( 3:5): “Every one who is called by the name of the Eternal will escape.” Rebbi Phineas gave on this subject two sermons, one in the name of Rebbi Zeïra, the other in the name of Rebbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai. Rebbi Phineas said in the name of Rebbi Zeïra, flesh and blood has a protector. If he bothers him too much, he will say: “There is X who will bother me.” But the Holy One, praise to Him, is not like that; He will receive you with all that you might bother him with. That is what is written ( 55:23) “Throw on the Eternal your burden and He will provide for you!” Rebbi Phineas said in the name of Rebbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai, flesh and blood has a protector. Enemies come and grab him at the door of his protector’s courtyard. While he is crying and before someone could come out, the sword already passes over his neck and kills him. But the Holy One, praise to Him, saved Jehoshaphat from the sword of the Syrians as it is written ( 18:34): “Jehoshaphat cried, the Eternal helped him and God turned them away from him.” That shows that only the cutting off of the head was missing, but God deflected them from him. Rebbi Zeīra, son of Rebbi Abbahu, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Eleazar ( 146:5): “Happy is he whom the God of Jacob helps.” What is written after that ( 146:6): “He makes Heaven and Earth.” What has one to do with the other? But a king of flesh and blood needs a protector, he rules over one district but not over another district. A universal ruler 1:1, the word is written קוזמוקרטור. There, the universal ruler is Alexander the Great. rules over dry land; does he rule over the ocean? But the Holy One, praise to Him, rules over ocean and dry land. He saves in the ocean from the water and on the dry land from the fire. He saved Moses from Pharao’s sword. He saved Jonah from inside the fish, Ḥananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, from the fiery oven, Daniel from the lions’ den. That is what is written ( 146:6) “He makes Heaven and Earth, the oceans and all that is in them.” Rebbi Tanḥuma said: A happening with a ship of Gentiles that sailed the great sea and on it was a Jewish child. There came upon them a big storm; each one got up, took his idol in his hand and called upon it, without result. When they saw that it was of no use, they said to that Jew: Son, get up, call on your God, for we heard that He answers you when you cry and He is strong. The child immediately got up with a full heart and cried; the Holy One, praise to Him, received his prayer and the sea quited down. When they came to dry land, each one descended to buy his needs. They said to that child, do you not want to buy anything for yourself? He said to them, what do you want from that unhappy stranger. They said to him: Are you an unhappy stranger? They are an unhappy stranger; they are here and their errors are in Babylonia, they are here and their errors are in Rome, they are here and their errors are with them, but are of no use to them. But you, everywhere you go, your God is with you. That is what is written ( 4:7): “Like the Eternal, our God, always when we call on Him!” Rebbi Simeon bar Laqish said, flesh and blood has a relative. If he is rich, he acknowledges him. If he is poor, he disawovs him. But the Holy One, praise to Him, is not like this; even if Israel is in deepest distress, He calls them My brothers and My friends. What is the reason ( 122:8): “For My brothers and friends.” Rebbi Abun, Rebbi Aḥa, and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: flesh and blood has a relative. If he is a philosopher, he says: “This X is related to us.” But the Holy One, praise to Him, calls all of Israel relatives; that is what is written ( 148:14): “He raises the fortunes of His people.” Our Mishnah if it was uprooted from all places of the Land of Israel, but if it was uprooted only from one place, he says: “Praise to Him Who uprooted paganism from this place.6:2, 3(2); they all apply the text of the Mishnah to a single destroyed temple, even though is a (later) text in the Galilean tradition. The following three sentences appear in the version of the Mishnah in these three sources.” If it was uprooted from one place but established at another place, there where it was reestablished he says: “Praise to Him Who is patient.” Where it was uprooted from, he says: “Praise to Him Who uprooted paganism from this place. May it be Your pleasure, our God and God of our fathers, that just as You uprooted it from this place, so uproot it from all other places and turn the heart of its worshippers to worship You.” Does he not pray for pagan worshippers? It was stated: Rebbi Simeon ben Gamliel says, also outside of the Land he must say this. Rebbi Yoḥanan, this paragraph and the one after the next are taken together; the insertion of the next paragraph is difficult to understand. The argument of R. Yoḥanan refers mostly to the parts of this and the preceding verses that are not quoted. “That is evil in all which is done under the sun, that the same happens to all; also, the heart of humans is full of evil, hooliganism is in their thoughts during their lifetime, but their end is with the dead. Who , all living beings have confidence; truly a living dog is better than a dead lion.” is the , the way the word is read, but “may choose” is the , the way it is written. The interpretation given the here is: All the living can have confidence that they may choose (the way of virtue), but death is final; nothing can be changed after death. Hence, a living dog (a living sinner) is better (might by repentance attain a higher state of holiness) than a dead lion (a good person.) said ( 9:4): “Who is it that has been connected?” It is written: “may choose.” All living beings have the certitude that as long as a human is alive, he has hope. When he dies, his hope is lost. What is the reason ( 11:7): “When an evil man dies, hope becomes lost.” It has been stated: Rebbi Yehudah 43b, “R. Meïr.” However, R. Rabbinowitz notes a German and an Egyptian manuscript of the Babli that have “R. Yehudah”, as well R. Isaac Fasi and , in line with the Yerushalmi and the Tosephta, 6:17. The entire paragraph is from R. Yehudah in the Tosephta. says, three things a man has to recite every day: Praise to Him Who did not make me a Gentile. Praise to Him Who did not make me uncivilized 43b–44a) it is reported that R. Jacob bar Aḥa changed this benediction to “Who did not make me a slave,” since an uncivilized person can become civilized; his state of ignorance is not God-given.. Praise to Him Who did not make me a woman. “Praise to Him Who did not make me a Gentile,” because Gentiles are not considered to be anything, ( 40:17) “all Gentiles are nothing before Him.” “Praise to Him Who did not make me uncivilized,” because an uncivilized person cannot fear sin 2:6.. “Praise to Him Who did not make me a woman,” because women are not commanded about benedictions. Rebbi Aḥa said, “Who is it that has been connected?” Even those that stretched out their arms against the Sanctuary have certitude. It is impossible to bring them near since they stretched out their arms against the Sanctuary. It is impossible to keep them far since they repented. On them it says ( 51:39): “They will sleep eternal sleep and never awake.” The rabbis of Caesarea say, Gentile minors 13:1, the opinion of Rabban Gamliel is quoted that children of (Jewish) evil doers (who die in infancy) have no part in the Future World, against the (prevailing) opinion of R. Joshua that all who die as children have part in the Future World, as it is written ( 116:6): “The Eternal is the guardian of the simple ones.”] and the armies of Nebuchadnezzar 13:5 it is said that “for those who stretched out their arms against the Sanctuary, the gates of hell will be locked and they will be punished there for all eternity.” It is explained here that this is valid only if they did not repent. will not live, but never will they be judged. On them Scripture says: “They will sleep eternal sleep, etc.” He who passes by a pagan temple says ( 15:25): “The Eternal will tear down the house of the haughty.” Rebbi Yose, son of Rebbi Abun, in the name of Rebbi Levi: “If he saw them sacrificing to an idol, he says ( 22:19): He who sacrifices to gods shall be devoted to destruction.” He who sees a black man 45b that a “black” man should not marry a “black” woman lest their children would be genuinely “black”., a red man, an albino, a beanstalk 45b defines קפח as a tall person whose frame is much too thin; the Mayence commentary ascribed to Rabbenu Gershom is the source of Rashi’s second explanation., or a dwarf, says: Praise to Him who makes unusual creatures; the amputee, the blind, or a person covered with boils, he says: Praise to the True Judge. This if they were whole and then changed. But if they were so from the mother’s womb: Praise to Him who makes unusual creatures. He who sees beautiful trees or beautiful people says: Praise to Him Who created beautiful creatures in His world. It happened that Rabban Gamliel saw a beautiful Gentile woman and recited a benediction over her. Did not say Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan ( 7:2): “Do not favour them,” do not ascribe charm to them? He did not say “may there be no harm” but “Who created beautiful creatures in His world,” since even if one sees a beautiful horse or a beautiful donkey, one says: Praise to Him Who created beautiful creatures in His world. Does Rabban Gamliel usually look at women? It was a curved road, like a and in , the spelling is פסווריס, R. Salomon Cirillo has פיוסרס. R. J. Levy conjectures Greek σπεῖρα “a spiral (road)”. R. M. Margalit (פני משה) thinks the word is Latinate, similar to Italian “passageway; bridge.” It could be Greek περίοδος, ἡ “way around, circuit, circular path” (E. G.).; he looked at her because he could not avoid her. If the cock crowed, one says: Praise to Him Who is wise in secrets; (38:36) “Who put wisdom in kidneys??” The insight of the is compared to the hidden knowledge of the kidneys, only accessible to God. The verse lends itself better to the Babylonian version (60b): “Praise to Him Who gave insight to the to distinguish between day and night.” The text of the Galilean benediction is a disapproved version of a benediction to be recited if one sees a great scholar, Babli 58b. The following explanation of words, parallel to one given in Babli 26a, refers to the determination of the meaning of the word (that is not quoted, only understood, at this moment.)”. Rebbi Levi said, in Arabia one calls sheep 26a; it must refer to the Hebrew usage of Jewish tribes in Arabia, not to Arabic. [There is an Arabic word וַבַלַ “giving lots of milk”.]; ( 6:5) “it will be when the ram’s horn is blown.” In Africa, the menstruating woman is called , ( 49:21) “I am childless and barren.” In Rome, near Aleppo., one calls a chicken ( 38:36) “who gave understanding to the ?” He who sees multitudes says: Praise to Him Who is wise in secrets! Just as their faces are not similar one to the other, so the opinions of one are not similar to another’s. When ben Zoma saw multitudes in Jerusalem, he said: Praise to Him Who created all these to serve me. How much did Adam toil until he could eat one piece of bread! He plowed, sowed, harrowed, weeded, harvested, bound sheaves, threshed, winnowed, selected, milled, sifted, made dough, split it, baked, and only after that could he eat a piece of bread. But I get up in the morning and find everything before me. See, how much toil Adam had to expend until he obtained a garment to wear! He sheared, bleached, separated the fibers, dyed, spun, weaved, washed, sewed, and after that he obtained a garment to wear. But I get up in the morning and find all before me. How many professionals work mornings and evenings! But I get up in the morning and find all before me. Similarly, ben Zoma said: What does a bad guest say? What did I eat from the householder, what did I drink from the householder? One piece I ate from him, one cup of wine I drank from him. All the effort he put in he did only for his wife and children! But a good guest says, praised be the householder, may the householder be remembered in a good way! How much wine did he bring before me, how many cuts did he bring before me! How much work did he do for me! All that effort he did only for me! And so it says ( 36:24): “Remember to magnify his work that people saw!”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: On s. v. ככב) or a meteorite (Rashi). s. v. זק quotes Rav Hai Gaon as defining זיקא as thunderless lightning that illuminates an entire cloud. The latter determination is probably the correct one since it fits the context of the Mishnah and its author has the highest authority among those who explain difficult words in the Talmudim., earthquakes, lightning, thunder, and hurricanes, one says: Praise to Him Whose power fills the world. On mountains, hills, seas, rivers, and deserts, one says: Praise to the Maker of Creation. Rebbi Yehudah says, he who sees the ocean says: Praise to Him Who made the ocean; if he sees it at intervals. On rains and good tidings one says: Praise to Him Who is good and does good. On bad news, one says: Praise to the True Judge. HALAKHAH: Bar Kappara stated: One blows the because of an earthquake on days other than Rosh Hashanah was only done on public fast days. This means that Bar Qappara declares an earthquake a catastrophy which requires repentance; hence, he disagrees with the Mishnah and requires the benediction “the True Judge” for an earthquake.. Samuel said: If that would pass by as the star that in Arabic is called , “Canopus”. Ibn Ezra identifies the word as meaning “Pleiades”. Since the Pleiades are seen only during summertime in the Northern Hemisphere, this might justify the characterization of as “hot” in the Babli (58b). The statement of Samuel and his qualifications are also quoted in the Babli (58b). The text of the Yerushalmi is quoted in slightly changed form in , s. v. ככב., it would destroy the world. They objected to Samuel: Do we not see that it passes by it? He said to them: It is impossible; either above or below it. Samuel said: I know the places of heaven like the places of my city Nahardea; except for that , I do not know what that is. Did Samuel ascend to heaven? No, following ( 38:37): “Who may discourse about heaven in wisdom?” Elijah, may he be well remembered, asked Rebbi Nehorai: Why do earthquakes occur in the world? He said to him, because of sin concerning heave and tithes. One verse says ( 11:12): The eyes of the Eternal, your God, are permanently on it. Another verse says ( 104:32): He who gazes on the Earth and it trembles, He touches mountains and they smoke. How can these two verses coexist? If Israel fulfill the will of the Omnipresent and separate their tithes following the rules, “the eyes of the Eternal, your God, are permanently on it from the start to the end of the year” and they will not be hurt by anything. If Israel do not fulfill the will of the Omnipresent and do not separate their tithes following the rules, “He gazes on the Earth and it trembles.” He said to him, my son, that is the reasonable explanation. But the main thing is that if the Holy One, praise to Him, sees theatres and circuses existing in safety and quiet, but His temple is destroyed, He is menacing His world to destroy it; that is what is written ( 25:30): “He will roar on His Place,” about His place. Rebbi Aḥa said, because of homosexual activity. The Holy One, praise to Him, said: You made your member tremble for something that is not for you; by your life, I shall make My world tremble because of that man. But the rabbis said, because of quarrels (Zach. 14:5): “You will flee by the valley of the mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach Aẓel Chap. 20)..” Rebbi Samuel said, an earthquake presages a change of government, as one says ( 51:29): “The earth quaked and trembled,” why? “for the intentions of the Eternal overtake Babylon.” Elijah, may he be well remembered, asked Rebbi Nehorai: Why did the Holy One, praise to Him, create abominable and crawling animals in His world? He said to him, they fill a need because, when men sin, He gazes at those and says, if I am keeping those who have no utility, certainly I shall keep these who might have utility. He said to him, still they have utility 77b, by Rav Yehudah in the name of Rav.: a fly for wasps 77b explains that as antidote for the poison of the sting of a wasp, one grinds up some flies and puts them as ointment on the sting. He explains the same for the use of for the sting of a scorpion, but the Babli () notes that the scorpion is afraid of the . Hence, it seems more likely that flies carry diseases into wasp’s nests and therefore curb their numbers, and eat scorpions., bedbugs for a leech, snail for skin rash, gives two Italian explanations of this word, the first “spider” is also given by Rashi () in Babli , the second “lizard” is more probable, in particular the gecko, Arabic סַאם אַבּרַצ, which is known to eat scorpions. Arabic סַאמָּה “poisonous animal”, but cf. Accadic “pidgeon”, “poisoning”. for the scorpion. “On lightning.” Rebbi Jeremiah, Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Ḥasdai: It is enough once a day. Rebbi Yose said, what are we talking about? If it is permanent, once a day is enough. If it is intermittent, one recites the benediction for each occurrence. The force of Rebbi Yose from the following 5:32, Babli 53a.: If he was sitting in the perfumer’s store all day long, he would recite the benediction only once. But if he enters and leaves, enters and leaves, he recites a benediction every time. It came, it was said by Rebbi Aḥa (and) Rebbi Ḥanina in the name of Rebbi Yose: If it is permanent, once a day is enough. If it is intermittent, one recites the benediction for each occurrence. If one was sitting in the bathroom or the room of filth. The Latin would be , “dregs, filthy matter”; Kohut compares Greek σφέκλη “dregs”., if he can exit and recite the benediction in time for one sentence, he should exit, but if not, he should not exit. Rebbi Jeremiah asked: If he was sitting naked in his house, should he make the house a garment, lean his head out of the window and recite the benediction? If he was sitting naked in a “tower” 10b), that a house, or any “tent”, can never be a garment. The substitute question now is whether a wooden movable cover can take the place of a textile cover. A similar question is asked in Babli 10b for somebody lying naked in bed and covered by a mosquito net; the answer is that it is possible only if the bed assembly does not qualify as a “tent.” The question here goes unanswered because, characteristic for R. Jeremiah, it is asked in a totally unrealistic form. [In contrast to the Babli, the Yerushalmi never requires that heart and genitals should be covered by separate garments.], should he make it a garment, lean his head out of the window and recite the benediction? “On winds what does he say? Praise to Him, Whose power and might fill the world.” The Mishnah if they come destructively. But if they come quietly, one says: Praise to the Maker of Creation. Rebbi Joshua ben Ḥananiah said: When the wind goes out into the world, the Holy One, praise to Him, breaks it on mountains, lets it stumble on hills, and tells it: Be careful not to hurt my creatures. What is the reason? ( 57:16) “The wind becomes faint before Me.” He makes it tired, as one says ( 2:8): “When I am fainting.” All that why? Rebbi Ḥuna in the name of Rebbi Aḥa ( 57:16): “And I made souls;” because of the souls that I made. Rebbi Ḥuna said, in three places did the wind come out without measure and desired to destroy the entire world; once in the time of Jonah, once in the time of Elijah, and once in the time of Job. In the time of Jonah ( 1:4): “The Eternal sent a strong wind.” In the time of Job ( 1:19): “A great wind came across the desert.” In the time of Elijah, from where? ( 19: 19:11) “Lo, the Eternal passes, and a great, strong wind, shattering mountains.” Rebbi Yudan ben Shalom Midrash. said, let us say that the one of Job was for him only, that of Jonah was for him only. You have only that of Elijah which was worldwide “Lo, the Eternal passes, etc. After that an earthquake and after the earthquake fire, but the Eternal was not in the fire.” “Rebbi Yehudah says, he who sees the ocean says: Praise to Him Who made the ocean, if he sees it at intervals.” What is an interval? Once in thirty days. Simeon the hard-working man (which appears here because it mentions Simeon Qamateria.) As a learned man, he is addressed in Hebrew, not in Aramaic. asked Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Since I am a donkey driver and go up to Jerusalem all the time, how do I have to tear? He said to him: If it is within thirty days, you do not have to tear, after thirty days you have to tear. Rebbi Ḥuna and Simeon Qamateria in the name of Rebbi Samuel ben Naḥman ( 18:30): “Jonathan ben Gershom ben Manasseh,” a hanging נ11:5, Babli 110a.. If he merits it, ben Mosheh. If he does not merit it, ben Manasseh. The colleagues asked before Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman: He was a priest of idol worship and lived so long Chapter 24) takes it as the time of captivity of king Manasse in Babylon; most later Medieval commentators (Ibn Ezra, Gersonides, R. Isaiah of Trani) take it to refer to the destruction of Shiloh (since Jeroboam put up a new Golden Calf at Dan, the original idol can no longer have survived.) However, as Y. Yadin has pointed out, already in the Song of Deborah there is a reference to the tribe of Dan who “went to dwell on ships.” Rashi’s interpretation is that of the Talmudim (the parallel in the Babli is 110a), since both have Jonathan (not just one of his descendants) alive and active at the time of David, about 300 years after the conquest of Laish by the tribe of Dan.? He said to them, because [Jonathan] was grudging to his idol. How was he grudging to his idol? If a man came to sacrifice an ox, a sheep, or a goat to the idol and told him: Make it favorably inclined towards me, would say: What use does it have for you? It neither sees, nor hears, nor eats, nor drinks, nor does good or evil, and does not talk. He said to him, by your life, what should we do? said to him, go, make, and bring me a wooden vessel full of fine flour and put on it ten eggs, then shall prepare it before that one and will eat from all that comes and shall make favorably inclined towards you! After he left, would eat it. One day, a son of pashas came and said that to him. He said to , if it is of no use, what are you doing here? said to him, because of my livelihood. When David became king, he sent and brought . He said to , you are the grandson of that righteous man and you worship idols? said to him: have a tradition from my grandfather’s house: Sell yourself to idol worship rather than need other people. He said to : Heaven forbid! He did not say so, but sell yourself to work that is strange to you rather than to need other people. When David saw that he loved money, he made him count, a high official in post-Diocletian Rome. “Treasury” from Greek θησαυρός. of his treasuries. That is what is written ( 26:24): “Shabuel ben Gershom ben Moshe, overseer of the treasuries.” “Shabuel” because he returned to God with all his heart and all his might. “Overseer of the treasuries,” that he made him count of the treasuries. They objected to Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman: ( 18:30): “Until the day the land went into exile.” He said to them, when David died, Shelomo rose and exchanged all his counselors, quoted earlier, seems to assume that he stayed in Jerusalem after that.. returned to his former bad ways. That is what is written: ( 13:11) “An old prophet was dwelling at Beth El;” they say that this was . He who sees the sun at its turning point, the moon at its turning point, and the sky in its purity, says: Praise to the Maker of Creation. Rebbi Ḥuna says, that means in the rainy season and only after three days. That is what is written ( 37:21): “Now they do not see light, etc. 23(8) reads: “ ‘Now they do not see light,’ we have formulated: He who sees the sun at its turning point, the moon in its spherical shape, the stars in their paths, the planets in their order, says: Praise to the Maker of Creation. Rebbi Ḥuna says, that means in the rainy season and only after three days.” Rabbenu Ḥananel, in his commentary to the Babli, takes sun, moon, stars, and planets all together and requires a benediction if any of them has not been seen for a prolonged time.” He who sees the moon in its renewal says: Praise to Him Who renews months 42a) notes that in Galilee one recites simply: “Praised are You, Eternal, our God, King of the Universe, Who renews months,” and that this is the formula used by women in Babylonia, but men in Babylonia use the formula “Praised are You, Eternal, our God, King of the Universe, Who renews months” only as conclusion of a longer prayer.. Until when? Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Yose) he is reported to have said in the name of R. Yoḥanan that one recites the benediction “until its (the moon’s) missing part is filled” and Rebbi Jacob bar Idi interprets this to mean that the appearance of the moon is no longer concave, i. e. that its visible circumference looks like a semicircle with its diameter (ascribed here to R. Jacob bar Aḥa). The people of Nehardea say, until after the 15th of the month, an interpretation which is more lenient than any opinion expressed here.: Until it is seen like half a stick. Rebbi Aḥa and Rebbi Ḥinena in the name of Rebbi Yose: Until its missing part is filled. The rabbis of Caesarea say, until the fourteenth day. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said, that is correct; the missing part is never filled before the fourteenth day. Hence, all fourteen days one needs to recite the benediction. In prayer prayer of the day of the New Moon., Rebbi Yose bar Nahorai said: “He Who sanctifies Israel, renews months.” Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said: “He Who sanctifies Israel and the New Moon.” Samuel said, one must say “bestow on us: “Bestow on us, o Eternal, our God, the blessing of Your holiday.” There is no mention of this and the following statement of Rav in any Babylonian source. Even though this might indicate concurrence of the Babli, the requirements of Samuel and Rav are not followed. [The Yerushalmi prayer texts from the Cairo Genizah show the Amidah of the days of the New Moon following the text of the holiday Amidah.].” Rav said, one must mention “time.” Rebbi Hoshaya stated: ( 1:14) “They should be for signs and appointed times, days and years. 6(3): “They shall be for signs”, these are the Sabbaths, “and appointed times,” these are the holidays of pilgrimage, “days,” these are the days of the New Moon, “and years,” that is the sanctification of years. [The Sabbath is called a sign in 31:13,17. The sanctification of years is the solemn declaration of a Jubilee year by the Synhedrion.] In this interpretation, the days of the New Moon are on the same level as holidays.” What says he who passes between graves that parallels the statement of R. Ḥanina here. An addition in the name of Rav Naḥman gives the second text of R. Yoḥanan here. The conclusion is simply “He Who makes the dead live.” In the Tosephta (6:6), the text is that of R. Yoḥanan with the longer conclusion of R. Yoḥanan. The medieval quotes of these texts differ widely, cf. p. 330, p. 109. It seems that the original benediction was simply: Praised are You, Eternal, Who makes the dead live. The longer texts are additions of Tannaïm of the last and Amoraïm of the first generations.? Praised are You, Eternal, Who makes the dead live. Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Who is true to His word and makes the dead live. Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: He Who knows your number will wake you up and remove the dust from upon your eyes. Praised are You, Eternal, Who makes the dead live. Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: Who created You by judgment, fed you by judgment, and removed you by judgment, He will in the future make you live by judgment. He Who knows your number will remove the dust from upon your eyes. Praised be He Who makes the dead live. That is, for Jewish dead. But for the dead of the Gentiles, he says ( 50:12): Your mother is very shameful, the one who bore you is ashamed …. He who sees the rainbow in the clouds says: Praised are You, Eternal, Who remembers the Covenant. Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Who is faithful to His Covenant and remembers the Covenant. The formula is not original with R. Yoḥanan; he simply chose one among several that were current.. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah: No rainbow was seen all the days of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah: Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai used to say, “Valley, valley, get filled with gold denars,” and it got filled his time in the study of Torah and did not earn money. Since it has been shown in the story of Jonathan ben Gershom that one may not take money from charity or contributions if one can avoid it at all, it is clear that he must have lived off his own money; otherwise he could not have been a just person.. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah: Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai used to say, I saw the people of the Future World and they are few 45b, 97b) explains that this refers only to the highest state attainable in the Future World. This is also implied by the rest of the paragraph where R. Simeon declares that he can bring practically everybody to the Future World. [It is obvious that in both places in the Babli, one has to read “Rebbi Ḥizqiah” instead of “Ḥizqiah” (in the current text), who would be the son of Rebbi Ḥiyya, preceding R. Jeremiah by two generations.]. If they are three, I and my son are of them. If they are two, they are me and my son. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah: Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai used to say, Abraham should bring near from his back to my back; I shall bring near from my back to the end of all generations. Otherwise, Aḥiya from Shiloh, Chapter 1, end. should join me and I shall bring everybody near. What reason did they have to take together good news and rains? Rebbi Berekhiah in the name of Rebbi Lewi: Because of ( 25:25) “cold water on a weary person and good news from a distant land.” How 1:3, 13(16). The text here follows the one in Taänit where it is supported by the Rome manuscript. much rain should fall that a man is required to recite a benediction? Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: At the start, that it should fertilize, at the end that the surface should be wet and , “that a brick should be wet.”. Rebbi Yannai ben Ismael in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: At the start, that it should fertilize, at the end that the seal of the amphora should be soaked. Is the seal ever soaked? But it is as if it were soaked. Rebbi Yose in the name of Rav Yehudah, Rebbi Jonah, Rav Yehudah in the name of Samuel: At the start, that it should fertilize, atthe end even a minimal amount. Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: It was said for fast days 25b, knows only of the rule of fertilizing.]. Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Naḥum, and Rav Ada bar Abimi were sitting. Rebbi Naḥum said to Rav Ada bar Abimi: Is it not reasonable that this was said for the benediction; he answered: Yes. Rebbi Ḥizqiah said to Rav Ada bar Abimi: Is it not reasonable that this was said for fast days; he answered: Yes. He said to him, why did you say “yes” here? He said to him, it is the argumentation of my teacher. Rebbi Mana asked Rebbi Ḥizqiah, who is his teacher? He said to him, Rebbi Zeïra. He said to him, but we say: Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: It was said for fast days. Rav Yehudah bar Ezechiel 6b), Rav Yehudah quotes a shorter text in the name of Rav. A longer text, patterned on the benediction after the recitation of Psalms on Sabbath and holidays with a different final doxology, is reported there in the name of R. Yoḥanan. It seems that long texts were never accepted in Galilee. said, my father used to recite for rainfall: May Your Name be magnified, sanctified, praised, and elevated, our King, for every drop that You bring down to us, and you make them refrain one from the other. ( 36:27) “For He reduces water drippings;” as one says ( 27:18): “Your value will be reduced.” Rebbi Yudan said, not only that, but He brings them down in measure, as it is said ( 28:25): “Water He determined by measure.” Rebbi Yose bar Jacob went to visit Rebbi Yudan from Migdal. While he was there, rain started to come down and he heard his (R. Yudan’s) voice saying: Thousands of thousands and myriads of myriads we are obliged to thank Your Name, our King, for every drop that You bring down to us, for You do good things for the guilty ones. He said to him: From where do you have this? He said to him: This is the benediction that Rebbi Simon recited for rainfall. How 1:4. In the Babli ( 25b) and the Yerushalmi source 13(13), Rebbi Meïr is reported to require that the rains penetrate the depth of the penetration of the plough-share (which is assumed to be three hand-breadths,) whereas R. Yehudah says that for dry earth, one hand-breadth was enough, for average ground two hand-breadths, and for well worked ground, three hand-breadths. If these are two equivalent formulations, then the text here has to be interpreted in the light of the text in Babli/Midrash: Not that R. Meïr requires a rainfall of three hand-breadths (10.8 inches) in one storm (or R. Yehudah rainfalls of 3.6, 7.2, 10.8 inches, respectively) but that the moisture has to penetrate the earth to the depth indicated. In that case, “dry earth” is simply the earth after the rainless summer months, average earth is the earth after the first winter storms, and well worked ground is the earth after an uninterrupted rain of seven days (the first, second, and third fertilizing periods in the language of Tosephta 1:4). R. Simeon ben Eleazar seems to object to both R. Meïr and R. Yehudah because rain will make the ground water level rise by twice the amount of rain water; hence, moisture in the ground can come from below as well as from above. One must assume that in the Yerushalmi also the measurements are those of moist spots in the earth and not of rainfall in the modern sense. much rain should fall that it is considered fertilizing? If it fills a vessel of three hand-breadths, the words of Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Yehudah says, the first rainfall one hand-breadth, the second one two hand breadths, and the third one three hand-breadths. It has been stated: Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar says, there is no hand-breadth that falls from above that the earth does not raise two hand-breadths towards it. What is the reason? ( 42:8) “The deep calls to the deep that clouds also are called “deep”. by the sound of Your water spouts.” And Rebbi Levi said: The upper waters are male and the lower ones female. What is the reason? ( 45:8) 6b that rain is the earth’s husband because in 55:10 it is said that rain makes the earth give birth, while Rebbi Abbahu (there and 59b) says that a benediction is recited only if “the bridegroom goes towards the bride,” meaning that drops jump up from the earth towards the descending rain. [This is the traditional interpretation, given by Ashkenazic Rabbenu Gershom and Sephardic Rabbenu Ḥanan‘el. Rashi, sensing the apparent contradiction, has a prosaic interpretation, that on both sides of the street the gutters will spout water one towards the other.] “The earth shall open,” like a female who opens before a male; “they should bear fruit of help,” that is being fruitful and multiplying; “and justice shall sprout together,” that is rainfall; “I, the Eternal, did create it,” for that I created it, for the well-being of the world. Rebbi Aḥa stated it in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Gamliel. In the Babli ( 6b), this passage appears as a statement of the Amora Rebbi Abbahu.: Why is it called “fertilizing,” because it impregnates the earth. Rebbi Ḥanina bar Yaqqa 1:3, 3:6, Midrash 13(19). In , the name is R. Ḥanania bar Yaqqa, in it is R. Ḥaninah bar Yasa, and in the Midrash it is R. Ḥanina ben R. ‘Izqa in the name of Rebbi (!) Yehudah. in the name of Rav Yehudah: The roots of wheat split the earth to a depth of 50 cubits. The soft roots of a fig tree split rock. It has been stated: Rebbi Ismael ben Eleazar and , as well as here in the Rome ms., correctly R. Simeon ben Eleazar; in the printed Midrash R. Eleazar ben R. Simeon, R. Simeon ben Eleazar in manuscripts. says, the earth drinks only according to its hardness. If this is so, what do the roots of the carob do? What do the roots of the sycamore do? Rebbi Ḥanina said, once every thirty days the abyss wells up and drenches them. What is the reason? ( 27:3) “I, the Eternal, watch over it and water it in moments.” Rebbi Zeïra said, it is stated there: If one notices cheapness coming to the world, plenty coming to the world, or a river supplying a city, one recites: He Who is good and does good. If he was told that his father had died, he says: “Praise to the True Judge.” He died and made him an heir, he says: “Praise to Him Who is good and does good.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If one built a new house or bought new garments, he says: Praise to Him Who let us reach this time. One recites the benediction for bad news containing good and for good ones containing bad. But if one cries about the past, that is a vain prayer. How is that? If his wife was pregnant and he said: May it be (God’s) pleasure that my wife would give birth to a male, that is a vain prayer. If he came from a trip, heard wailing in town, and said: May it be (God’s) pleasure that this should not be in my house, that is a vain prayer. HALAKHAH: “If one built a new house or bought new garments, etc.” Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: Not only new ones, but even used ones if they are new for him. Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi said in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: If he bought [a garment], he says: “Praise to Him Who made us live, preserved us, and let us reach this time.” If it was given to him, he says: “Praise to Him Who is good and does good.” Rebbi Abba, father of Rebbi Abba Mari, in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: If he bought, he says: “Praise to Him Who let us reach this time.” If it was given to him, he says: “Praise to Him Who is good and does good.” If he wears the garment, he says: “Praise to Him Who clothes the naked.” He 6:9 which is quoted in Babli 46a; the note about the benediction when making a or for somebody else is found only here. Hence, the source here is not the Tosephta which also starts with a general declaration that: “A person performing any recites a benediction over it.” The practice of the Babli does not follow the discussion in 46a but a statement in 42b that no benediction is due for a preparatory action, such as making the or the , but only for the required act itself such as living in the or taking the . who makes a for himself, says: “He Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us to make a .” For others: “to make a in that one’s name” and that the person has in mind the name of the person for whom he is doing it. It seems rather that one has to pronounce the recipient’s name at the place reserved for לשמו..” If he enters it, he says: “Praise to Him Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us to dwell in a .” After he recited the benediction in the first night of the holiday he does not have to recite it again), this is the opinion of the Babylonian Samuel, supported by the Tosephta. In the name of the Galilean R. Yoḥanan, it is reported that one has to recite the benediction every day. Since R. Yohanan is a higher authority than Samuel, Babylonian practice followed what there is declared to be Galilean.. He who makes a for himself, says: “He Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us to make a .” For others: “to make a in that one’s name.” If he uses it, he says: “Praise to Him Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us to take a ,” and “He Who let us live.” He recites the benediction every time that he takes it and has been explained in Halakhah 3:3.. He who makes a for himself, says “to make a .” For somebody else, “to make a for his name.” When he nails it to the doorpost, he recites: “Praise to Him Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us to about .” He who makes for himself.”, etc. For somebody else, etc. When he puts them on, he says “about the commandment of . are put on, in contrast to the amoraïc text of Halakhah 2:3, that requires two benedictions, one for on the arm and one for the head. Similarly, the discussion below on the timing of benedictions is based on having only one benediction. The Tosephta (6:10), representing the Babylonian text as always, does not have the notes on working for somebody else and requires here the formula “to put on ,” which is the main benediction in the Babli ( 42b), followed in Sephardic practice.” He who makes for himself, etc. For somebody else etc. When he wraps himself in them, etc..” The Babylonian formula is “to wrap ourselves in .”. He who separates and tithes says: “Praise to Him Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us to separate and tithes.” For somebody else, “to separate and tithes for his name.” He who slaughters must say: “Praise to You, Eternal, our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us about .” He who covers [the blood 17:13.] says, “about covering the blood.” He 127b. The text of the Tosephta is closer to the Babli than to the Yerushalmi. who circumcizes must say: “Praised Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us about circumcision.” The child’s father says: “Praised Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us to induce him into the covenant of our forefather Abraham.” Those who are standing there must say: “Just as you made him enter the covenant, so make him enter Torah and the marriage canopy.” He who recites the benediction must say: “Praised Who sanctified the beloved from the womb, Who put a statute in his flesh, and sealed his descendants with a holy sign of covenant; therefore, as a reward for this, o living God, our part, our rock, command to save the beloved of our flesh from destruction. Praised are You, o Eternal, Who seals the covenant.” When does one recite the benediction for commandments? Rebbi Yoḥanan said, just before he starts doing them 7b) is: “Everybody agrees that one makes the benediction beforehand, as Rav Yehudah said in the name of Samuel: On all commandments one recites the benediction just before he starts doing them.” This tradition must be later when the authority of R. Yoḥanan overrode earlier Babylonian practices.. Rav Huna said, when he does it. Rav Huna agrees with Samuel, since Rebbi Yose bar Abun said in the name of Samuel: All commandments need a benediction while one is doing them except blowing, sine obviously one cannot blow and recite the benediction at the same time. and immersion, when one is naked and forbidden to recite a benediction. The Yerushalmi requires a benediction before immersion. In the Babli ( 7b), the statement about blowing and immersion is an addition to the statement that all benedictions must precede the action. It is clear that the mention of blowing in that context makes no sense; that statement is then dropped and only immersion is left for a benediction the act. The Yerushalmi shows that in the Babli we have a later confluence of older (Rav Huna) Babylonian tradition with the adoption of Galilean (R. Yoḥanan) practice by the editors of the Talmud., and, some say, by sexual relations is the first stage of a marriage in which the bride becomes bound to the husband, in preparation for , which lets the couple live together. Usually, is effected by the groom giving a valuable gift (usually a gold ring) to the bride. But the Mishnah ( 1:1) lists sexual relations (in front of two witnesses) as a possible form of . One may assume that in Israel this option was never used. In Babylonia it seems to have been used since the Babli ( 12b) reports that Rav had people whipped (for indecent exposure) who married by public sex act. In any case, the required benediction cannot be pronounced while the parties are naked.. Rebbi Jonah said, you have others: on the hand before he takes them off, and on the head before he puts “to give.” them on and, as explained earlier (2:3), in Galilee a benediction was recited when were taken off. Since the Torah mentions () on the hand always before those on the head, one must put on first those for the arm and take off first those for the head. Even Rav Huna agrees that the benediction for removal was recited before were removed from the arm and the one for putting them on was recited before those of the head were put on.. Before he puts them on? When he puts on on the arm and on the head are always mentioned together in one verse, the putting on (or taking off) of both is one act and the recitation of the benediction covers both ., he puts them on! When does one recite the benediction for ? Rebbi Yoḥanan says, if he prepares to slaughter. Yose ben Nehorai says, after he slaughtered. Why? Maybe its slaughtering is producing a carcass. Now, should he not first check the signs, “torn” and unfit for consumption. The Yerushalmi seems to extend the meaning of “signs” to all internal organs, especially lungs and the digestive system, holes of which render an animal unfit for consumption. The question here is: why not wait with the benediction until the entire animal has been dissected and checked for possible ?? The of intestines is that they are in order, the interpretation here by necessity has to follow the Babylonian tradition. The position of the latter has been formulated by Rav Huna: A living animal is in the continuing state () of being forbidden until it has been ascertained that it was correctly slaughtered; once it has been correctly slaughtered, it is in the continuing state () of being permitted food until it has been ascertained whether and why it is . If the slaughter was ascertained to be correct and inner parts were then taken by an animal before they were checked, the meat remains permitted food.. It was stated: If it was slaughtered and the wolves took its innards, it is in order. Should one question whether they were pierced cannot now be ascertained?? Rebbi Abba in the name of the rabbis from there 9a that Rebbi Abba asked precisely this question from Rav Huna.: Intestines have that they are in order. In the house of Yannai they said, if she is sitting on the birthing stool. Hence, before that he should pray, because of ( 18:6) “Lo, like clay in the potter’s hand …” Rebbi Yehudah ben Pazi 72(6). In the latter source, R. Jehudah ben Pazi is in opposition to the house of Rebbi Yannai and says that even if labor has started, as long as the baby is not born one may pray because of the verse from Jeremiah. in the name of the house of Yannai: The main pregnancy of Dinah was as a male. After the prayer of Rachel, she became a female. That is ( 30:21): “Afterwards, she gave birth to a daughter and called her name Dinah.” After the prayer of Rachel, she became a female. And Rebbi Yehudah ben Pazi in the name of the house of Rebbi Yannai: Our mother Rachel was of the early prophetesses (Buber 19, Standard 8), Leah was the prophetess who knew that Jacob would have 12 sons and if she had 7 sons then her sister would be left with only one son, less than any of the maids. She therefore prayed that her pregnancy should be that of a girl. All Midrashim derive the name of Dinah not from דין “law, lawsuit”, but from די “enough”, meaning “we already have enough boys.”. She said, another one will be from me. That is what is written ( 30:24): “May the Eternal add me another son.” She did not say , but will be from me. If he returns from a trip, what does he say: I am sure that these are not in my house. Hillel the elder said ( 112:7): “He will not be afraid of bad news.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who enters a fortified place prays two prayers, one when he enters and one when he leaves. Ben Azai said four, two when he enters and two when he leaves. He gives thanks for the past and implores for the future. HALAKHAH: “He who enters a fortified place says two prayers, one when he enters and one when he leaves.” What does he say when he enters? May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You will bring me into this fortress for peace. When he leaves, he says: May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, etc. “Ben Azai said four, two when he enters and two when he leaves.” When he is about to enter, he says: May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You will bring me into this fortress for peace. After he entered, he says: I thank You, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that I entered in peace; so may it be Your pleasure that You will lead me out of it for peace. When he wants to leave, he says: May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You will lead me out from this fortress in peace. When he left, he says: I thank You, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You made me leave in peace; so may it be Your pleasure that You will lead me to my house for peace (or, to place X for peace.) (Dimitrovsky) fol. 49 has only two prayers, corresponding to the opinion of the first Tanna in the Mishnah, which is disregarded in the other versions: “What does he say when he enters? May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God, that you will let me leave this fortress for peace. When he left, he says: I thank You that You guided me out of this fortress for peace, and just as You led me out in peace, so let me travel in peace, lead me in peace, and save me from the hand of any enemy or ambush on the road. Praise to You, Eternal, Who listens to prayer.” The doxology that makes this a benediction is found only in the Spanish incunabula print and in §87; it is expressly denied, in the tradition of the Babli, by Ravad (R. Abraham ben David of Posquières) in his critique of R. Zeraḥiah Halevi in . That means, if it is inhabited by Gentiles, but if it is inhabited by Jews, he does not have to recite the benedictions. But if it was a place where they kill, even in a Jewish dwelling he must recite the benediction. If one enters the toilet, he recites two benedictions, one before and one after. When he enters, what does he say? Honor 91:11) that they should let him go alone to a place unworthy of their presence. In the Babli (60b), Abbai objects to a similar version since it might imply permanent dismissal of the guardian angels. to you, honored, holy servants, this is the way of the world, let me go. Praise to the God of glory! When he leaves, what does he say? Praise to Him Who created man in wisdom 56b. For the translation it was derived from Arabic כַּנִין “hiding places”. [Also compare Latin “reed, pipe”. Since חלולים can mean “round pipes”, חלולים כניניות would be Semitic-Latinate synonyms “pipes-pipes” (E. G.).]. When one enters the thermal bath, he prays twice; once on entering and once on leaving. When he enters, he says: “May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God, that You may save me from being burned in fire, damaged by hot water or from collapse. Nothing should happen to me, but if it happens let my death be atonement for all my sins; save me from this and from the similar one in the future world.” When he leaves, he says: “I thank You, o Eternal, my God, that You saved me from fire.” Rebbi Abbahu said, that is for a thermal bath which is heated. But in a thermal bath that is not heated, he says only “from damage by hot water”. Rebbi Ḥilqiah and Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: The prayer at a bathhouse does not require standing.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: One is required to recite a benediction for bad things the same way it is said for good things, as it is written ( 6:5): “You must love the Eternal, your God, with all your heart, all your soul, and all your force.” “With all your heart,” with your two instincts, the goodinstinct and the bad instinct. “With all your soul,” even if He takes your soul. “With all your force,” with all your money. Another explanation: “With all your force,” for every measure that He measures for you, for everything thank him very much. A person should not behave improperly before the Eastern gate, which lies in a straight line with the Holiest of Holies. And one should not enter the Temple Mount with his walking stick, sandals, money belt., or dust on his feet. Also one should not use it as a short cut (), cf. Chapter 1, Note 36., and certainly not spit there. All endings of benedictions in the Temple were “from eternity 9:5): “Praised be the Eternal, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity,” to emphasize the two worlds, the existing one and the one to come. The heretics here cannot be Sadducees who started about three hundred years later; the Qumran documents show that it is totally false to impute a denial of the future world to Sadducees. [That “heretics” are called “Sadducees” in many editions of the Babli here is due to Christian censors who misunderstood the use of the word מין which in general, but not here, means “Christians.”].” When heretics did err and said that there was only one world, they ordained that one should say “from eternity to eternity.” They also instituted that one should greet his friend by the Name, as it was said ( 2:4): “Lo, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters: The Eternal be with you!” And it says ( 23:22): “Be not contemptuous because your mother got old.” ( 119:126) “It is time to work for the Eternal; they violated Your Torah.” Rebbi Nathan says, they violated Your Torah, it is time to work for the Eternal. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Berekhia in the name of Rebbi Levi: Because of ( 92:5) “You are always exalted, o Eternal!” Your position is always the strongest. Usually in the world, if a king of flesh and blood sits in judgment, if he dismisses, throwing out the indictment., everybody acclaims him; if he sentences to execution “thorn, dart, pointed instrument; arrow”., everybody says bad things about him since he is sweeping in his sentences. But the Holy One, praise to Him, is not so, rather: “You are always exalted, o Eternal!” Your position is always the strongest. Rebbi Ḥuna in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: ( 101:1) “A song of David. Kindness and justice I shall sing, to You, o Eternal, I shall chant.” David said before the Holy One, praise to Him: If You act in kindness towards me, I shall sing. If You act in judgment towards me, I shall sing. In any case, I shall chant. Rebbi Tanḥuma ben Yehudah said, ( 56:11) “In God I will praise words, in the Eternal “power”, is always interpreted in the Talmud as “the measure of justice” acting by the immovable laws of the Creation. “Eternal” is traditionally interpreted as designating God the Merciful, Whose mercy is not subject to natural law. I will praise words.” On measures of judgment as on measures of mercy I shall praise words. But the sages say ( 116:13): “I lift the cup of salvation, I call on the Name of the Eternal, trouble and sorrow I will find, but on the Name of the Eternal I shall call.” Whatever may happen to me, I shall call on the Name of the Eternal. Rebbi Yudan bar Pelaya said: This is what Job said ( 1:21): “The Eternal gave, and the Eternal took, may the Name of the Eternal be praised!” When He gave, He gave in mercy; when He took, He took in mercy. In addition, when He gave, He did not consult anybody, but when He took, He consulted His Court. Rebbi Eleazar said, everwhere it says “ the Eternal” it means Him and His Court. The paradigm of this is ( 22:23): “And the Eternal spoke woe over you.” 5:5; in the transcription the introductory sentences were lost. There, the question is raised that one verse in Deuteronomy says: “You must love the Eternal, your God,” as quoted in our Mishnah, but another verse declares: “The Eternal, your God, you must fear.” How does one square these two verses? The answer is that both are required, as explained in the following. Act from love and act from fear. Act from love, because if you are tempted to hate, know that you must love and a lover is no hater. Act from fear, because if you are tempted to rebel, know that you must fear and one who fears does not rebel. There are seven kinds of religious people 5:5; a slightly different list with completely different interpretations in Babli 22b declares explicitly that the first five are “destroyers of the world.” In the Yerushalmi, it is clear that the first five are considered in a negative light but they are still considered better than one who performs no commandments whatsoever. פרוּש “Pharisee” is the designation of anybody who separates himself from impurity; in particular, one who follows the teachings of the rabbis.: Religious on the shoulder, religious on credit, religious balancing, religious “what is the deduction,” religious “I shall do it when I realize my guilt,” religious from fear, religious from love. Religious on the shoulder, he carries his deeds onhis shoulder. Religious on credit, “give me credit that I can perform commandments. while he only wants the money and has no intention of performing the (); I cannot pay now because I am occupied with a (); give me money because I am so holy that I cannot go and earn money (Z. ).” Religious balancing, he commits one sin and observes one commandment and balances one against the other. Religious “what is the deduction,” what I have that is what I am using to deduct for doing a commandment. Religious “I shall do it when I realize my guilt,” I committed that sin and therefore I shall do this good deed to counteract it. Religious from fear, like Job. Religious from love, like Abraham. No one is beloved as much as the religious from love, like Abraham. Our forefather Abraham turned the evil instincts into good ones as it is written ( 9:8): “You found his heart trustworthy before You.” Rebbi Aḥa said, he compromised, from “concluding a covenant with him.” But David could not stand them and killed them in his heart. What is the reason? ( 109:22) “But my heart is slain in me.” Rebbi Aqiba was tortured before the evil Tineius Rufus 50b), Rufus’s rich wife had divorced him, converted to Judaism, and married Rebbi Aqiba. A story closely similar to the one given here is told in the Babli (61a).. There came the time for reciting the . He started to read and laughed. He said to him: Old man, you are either a sorcerer or one contemptuous of suffering. He said to him: The spirit of this man should be blown away; I am neither a sorcerer nor contemptuous of sufferings. But all my life I read this verse and said, when will I have occasion for these three ( 6:5): “You must love the Eternal, your God, with all your heart, all your soul, and all your force.” I loved Him with all my heart. I loved Himwith all my money. But whether with all my soul I could not test. But now, when “with all your soul” came, the time of reciting the has arrived and my mind has not wavered, therefore I am reciting and laughing. He had not finished speaking when his soul flew away. Neḥemiah from Emmaus 26a) or Neḥemiah from Emmaus ( 22b) was the teacher of Rebbi Aqiva; Naḥum is also quoted as teacher in Yerushalmi sources ( 22, 53) but in a very critical sense. Hence, it seems that Naḥum was the developer of a rudimentary method of explaining the Torah by looking at expressions that mean inclusions or exclusions, that the method was made satisfactory only by R. Aqiba, and that Neḥemia was R. Aqiba’s student. (The tradition of the name in 22b is doubtful.) The method of inclusions and exclusions is much more general than the limited use made here in identifying particles which have extending or limiting character; its use is always called “the method of R. Aqiba”, in contrast to the “method of R. Ismael”, which is based on generalities and specifications. served Rebbi Aqiba for 20 years and he taught him “את and גם mean additions, אך and רק mean exclusions.” He asked him: What means that which is written ( 6:13) “את the Eternal, your God, you must fear.” He said to him, Him and His Torah. It was stated: He who urinates turns his face towards North. He who spreads his feet turns his face towards South. Rebbi Yose bar Abun deals with” since in the next formulation, and in the parallel to that in the Babli (61b), R. Yose the Tanna is quoted that these rules hold only if one can see Jerusalem. But one should hesitate to follow them since in the comment of the Babli (61b) on the prohibitions of the Mishnah, the statement attributed here to the fifth generation R. Yose bar Abun is there credited to the fourth generation R. Abba, son of R. Ḥiyya bar Abba, in the name of R. Yoḥanan; it is clearly Amoraic. But R. Abba adds that all the rules apply only when the Temple exists (following R. Yehudah in the next ), and this is emphatically negated by the Yerushalmi. said, this is from Mount Scopus towards the interior. Rebbi Aqiba says, everywhere quite strictly, E-W and N-S, not the direction towards Jerusalem. They seem to suggest that everybody has to feel himself to be in Jerusalem everywhere in the world. It is impossible to say what the opinion of the Yerushalmi would be in this question. but only where there is no wall. If was stated: He who spreads his feet should not face East with his back facing West but at an angle. Rebbi Yehudah says, when the Temple exists. Rebbi Yose said, from Mount Scopus towards the interior. Rebbi Aqiba says, everywhere but only where there is no wall. Rebbi Aqiba said, I entered once after Rebbi Joshua to see the action. They asked him, what did you see? He said to them, I saw him sitting and his side was towards the West; he did not undress until he was sitting, he did not sit down before he rubbed, and he did not cleanse himself with his right hand but with his left hand 7 explain that R. Eliezer says, because one eats with his right hand; R. Joshua says, because one writes (words of Torah) with the right hand; R. Aqiba says, because one uses the right hand to show the musical signs when reciting the Torah.. Simeon ben Azai also said so: I entered once after Rebbi Aqiba to see the action. They asked him, what did you see? Etc. It was stated 6:19.: Nobody should enter the Temple Mount in shoes, with dust on his feet, or his coins tied up in his head-scarf, or his money belt on him outside. What is the reason? ( 4:17) “Watch your feet when you go to God’s house.” Rebbi Yose ben Yehudah says ( 4:2): “He came as far as the king’s gate because nobody may enter the king’s gate in sackcloth.” He said, if it is so for a foul smelling drop, so much more for the gate of the Omnipresent! “ One should not use it as a short cut, and certainly one should not spit there.” If you say that wearing shoes, which is a respectful way, is forbidden, spitting, which is disrespectful, so much more. If was stated: One did not say “Amen” in the Temple. What did they say? “Praised be His glorious name forever and ever.” From where that one did not say “Amen” in the Temple? The verse says ( 9:5): “Rise up and praise the Eternal, etc.” From where that this is for every single benediction, the verse says: “And Elevated for every benediction and praise. they shall praise Your glorious name and Elevated and praise. The Tosephta (6:22), quoted Babli 63a, explains that this means: For every single benediction and every single praise.” Rebbi Joshua the Southerner said: Three things did the earthly court decree and the Heavenly Court agreed with them, and they are the following: The ban on Jericho, the Esther scroll, and greeting people using the Name. The ban on Jericho ( 7:11): “Israel sinned for the Eternal. After Akhan had taken property for himself, Israel was defeated at the Ai and Joshua was informed that “Israel sinned,” i. e., a transgression of his command was equated with a transgression of a divine command. Hence, Heaven accepted his human decree in the Heavenly Court. [While everybody can declare his own possession or whereby its use is forbidden by a divine command ( 27), Joshua here forbade the use of things that did not belong to him and, under usual circumstances, his decree would be invalid in a court of law.].” But was not Joshua the one who decreed it? This certainly implies that the Heavenly Court agreed with them. The Esther scroll ( 9:27): “They confirmed and accepted, etc.” Rav said, “accepted” is written in singular; this implies that they accepted. Greeting people using the Name ( 2:4): “Lo, Boaz came from Bethlehem.” And from where that the Heavenly court agreed with them? The verse says ( 6:12): “The Eternal is with you, o hero! Chap. 12 (in the author’s edition and commentary, Northvale N.J. 1998, p. 121–123.) Boaz was the grandson of Naḥshon ben Aminadav, prince of Judah during the wanderings in the desert ( 4:20–21.)” Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Also tithes, as it is said ( 3:10): “Bring all tithes 6:1, 1:9 and Babli 32b, referring to the obligations of the farmer regarding the produce of the Holy Land. It is spelled out in the Torah many times that these obligations (the heave for the priests, tithes for the Levites and the poor, the Sabbatical Year, etc.) come into force “when you come to the Land and inherit it,” as duties on the land distributed as family heritage to the tribes by Moses and Joshua. These commandments became obsolete when the tribes were led into captivity, including the obligations of the remaining Israelite population of Galilee who, according to our sources, were never exiled and who reappear in history at the time of the Hasmonean revolt without any record of resettlement in Galilee. The continued obligation to observe the Laws that depend on the Land therefore is derived only from the voluntary covenant enacted by the people in the time of Ezra and Nehemia ( 6:1): “Rebbi Lezer says: they voluntarily accepted the duties of the tithes. Why do I say this? ( 10:1) ‘With all this, we enact a written trust and covenant signed by our princes, Levites, and priests.’ How does R. Lezer explain the inclusion ( 10:37) of ‘the firstborn of our cattle and flocks’ [an obligation that does not depend on the Land and therefore is universal]? Since they accepted the obligations (of heave and tithes) that they could have avoided, Scripture gives them credit for those obligations which they had to fulfill anyhow as if they had accepted these also voluntarily.” The same idea is also expressed by an opponent of rabbinic Judaism who is reported ( 9:9) to have said: “ (the heave to be taken from bread dough) is a biblical obligation ( 15:20) but the Sabbatical year is now an obligation only by the authority of Rabban Gamliel and his colleagues.” [Cf. the author’s p. 280–281, and p. 248–250.], etc.” What is: “ 3:10: “Bring the full tithe into the (Temple) storehouse, so that there may be food in My House, test Me in this,” said the Eternal of Hosts, “if I will not open for you the skylights of heaven, and I shall pour out for you blessing until ‘without enough.’ ” The obligation accepted by the people on Earth without Heavenly Command gives Divine Reward. Hence, the obligation was accepted as Divine Command of human origin. Until ‘without enough?’ ” Rebbi Yose bar Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: The thing about which it is impossible to say “enough”, that is blessing. Rebbi Berekhiah and Rebbi Chelbo and Rebbi Abba bar Ilaï in the name of Rav: Until your lips will wear out 1:1 (which contains an enlarged version of the Yerushalmi here to the end of the tractate) that Elkanah went to Siloh four times a year, three times for the three holidays of pilgrimage and once for his private vow as explained in 1:2, and that every year he chose a different road to tell people to go to Shiloh for the holidays. A similar version is in I:8. saying, we have enough blessings, we have enough blessings. ( 23:22): “Be not contemptuous because your mother got old.” Rebbi Yose bar Abun said, if words of Torah become old in your mouth, do not become contemptuous about them. What is the reason? “Be not contemptuous because your mother got old.” Rebbi Zeïra said, when your people got old, get up and repair it the way Elkanah did who instructed Israel in the pilgrimage for holidays. That is what is written: ( 1:2) “This man went up from his town 1:1 (which contains an enlarged version of the Yerushalmi here to the end of the tractate) that Elkanah went to Siloh four times a year, three times for the three holidays of pilgrimage and once for his private vow as explained in 1:2, and that every year he chose a different road to tell people to go to Shiloh for the holidays. A similar version is in I:8., etc.” ( 119:126) “It is time to work for the Eternal, they violated Your Torah.” Rebbi Nathan inverts the verse: “They violated Your Torah, it is time to work for the Eternal.” Rebbi Ḥilqiah in the name of Rebbi Simon: He who restricts his Torah to fixed times breaches the covenant. What is the reason? “They violated Your Torah, it is time to work for the Eternal.” It was stated: Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai says: If you see that people have given up on Torah, get up and strengthen yourself in it and you will receive the reward of all of them. What is the reason? “They violated Your Torah, it is time to work for the Eternal!” Hillel the elder used to say: When they collect, spread. And when they spread, collect. So Hillel used to say, if you see that the Torah is beloved by Israel and everybody enjoys it, spread. And if not, collect.Rebbi Eleazar said, just as the baby needs to suckle at all times of the day, so every Jew needs to exert himself in Torah all all times of the day. Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Gezirah 89a in the name of the earlier Galilean R. Isaac.], all small talk is bad but small talk of Torah is good. All lies are good and the lies of Torah are bad, the reading is Aramaic כרבייא “plowings” instead of כדבייא “lies.” This has support in the introduction of R. Zeraḥiah Halevi to his who reads Hebrew חרשיא “plowings.” Since the roots חרש (Arabic חרת̇) “to plow” and חרש (Arabic ח̇רשׂ) “to be silent” are identical in Hebrew, both authors give the interpretation” silence” also to the Aramaic equivalent כרב. The author of reads ברכייא, “blessings.” All these authors read first “bad” then “good” as in the preceding sentence; Rabbenu Jonah even quotes the sentence about silence as alternative reading for “small talk.” Many commentators write here that the sentence should be: All lies are bad and the lies of Torah are good, referring to lies such as Eliezer’s when he met Rebecca, first gave her gold rings and then inquired after her family but in his recital to them pretended to first having asked about her family and only afterwards given her the heavy gold jewelry, to keep within accepted norms of behavior.. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said: In a scroll of the pious they found written: If you abandon me for one day, I shall abandon you for two days. An example of two people who went, one from Tiberias and one from Sepphoris, and met at a certain shelter. As soon as they parted and each one went one , they were separated two . Or a woman who sat and waited for a man. All the time that he intended to marry her, she sat and waited for him. When he put her out of his mind, she went and married another. It was stated 43b) has the formulation that “every man in Israel is obliged to recite 100 benedictions every day.” In the Yerushalmi and the Tosephta, not only benedictions are counted but all religious deeds, and it is asserted that the number 100 is reached automatically. in the name of Rebbi Meïr: There is no one in Israel who does not perform 100 commandments every day. He recites the and benedictions before and after, eats his bread and recitesbenedictions before and after, prays 18 benedictions three times and then he performs other commandments and recites benedictions after them. Similarly, Rebbi Meïr used to say: There is no man in Israel who is not surrounded by commandments: on his head, on his arm, a on his door, circumcision in his flesh, and the four of his surround him. That is what David said ( 119:164): I praised You sevenfold every day for Your just laws 12) must consider as one commandment. In Babli and Tosephta, circumcision is not counted, probably because the fact of circumcision goes to the credit of the parents, not the baby, and, therefore, must count for two commandments.. And so it says ( 34:8): The angel of the Eternal camps around those that fear Him and rescues them. When he entered the bath house, he saw himself naked. He said, woe to me that I am stripped of commandmends. When he looked at his circumcision, he started to acclaim the Holy One, praise to Him ( 12:1): For the director, on the eighth, a song from David. Rebbi Eleazar said in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: The students of the Sages increase peace in the world. What is the reason? ( 54:13) “All your sons are students of the Eternal, and ample peace is for your sons.”",
