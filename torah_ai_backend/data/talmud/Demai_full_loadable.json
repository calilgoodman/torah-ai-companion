    "text_en": "MISHNAH: The easy ones for is given in the Introduction. The “easy ones” are those to which the laws of do not apply and which may be bought from any source without separating heave or tithe. are 2:5, Note 86.) It will be explained that these are figs growing under the leaves. Since figs need much sun to ripen, normally figs grow on top of the leaves, exposed to the sun. Those growing under the leaves remain hard and inedible at harvest time and are not usually harvested. Hence, these figs are to be considered abandoned property after the harvest and are not subject to any laws of heave and tithes., lotus fruit, ed. Luncz, Jerusalem 1899, p. 526, notes that in Falastini Arabic the fruit is called אַלדוּם., the fruit of the service tree, white figs 40b)., and sycamore figs, fallen dates, fennel 3, p. 462. Maimonides declares it to be “a relative of dill.” The Arukh declares it to be wild grapes, Italian . This follows the Babli ( 40b) which defines it to be grapes that ripen only after the harvest., and capers) and Maimonides. This refers to the fruit only.. Also in Judea sumac, vinegar, and coriander. Rebbi Jehudah says, all are free except those from a tree bearing fruit twice a year, all lotus fruit are free except lotus fruit from Shiqmanah, and all sycamore fruits are free except those cracked open, Book XIII, §56. In all these instances, R. Jehudah insists that the fruits do not grow wild and/or are not abandoned.. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Sages enumerated them because the majority of these kinds are collected only from abandoned property. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, only is mentioned, hence one is obligated can one get away with giving only 1%. (This argument appears anonymously in Babli 40b.) if they are certain. Rebbi Joḥanan said, they are free whether or certain. It is difficult for Rebbi Joḥanan, didn’t they mention only Hence if it is certain, is it not obligated or , but here it refers explicitly to .? Rebbi La said, since at every place is a mnemotechnic device which starts tractate . It has no intrinsic meaning. he considers only , here he quotes only . The Mishnah supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “From Akhzib. 19:29, . 1:31. Along the seashore, Kezib or Akhzib denotes the northernmost point of contiguous settlement by Jews during the Second Commenwealth. As explained in the Introduction, agricultural land outside this area is in principle free from all obligations imposed on the Land. (Exceptions are discussed in Chapter 2, Halakhah 1 and, for the Tithe of the Poor only, in Tractates and .) and further on it is free from .” Is not from Akhzib and further on no difference between and certainty? Here also there is no difference between and certainty. A 1:1: “The easy ones for ,, lotus fruit, and the fruit of the service tree, may be trusted everywhere to be free (from obligation of tithes), but if they are kept in storage they are obligated.” disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: “If they were kept in storage they are obligated.” Did they not essentially come from abandoned property? He explains it, if most people keep them in storage. Come and see, if most people keep them in storage, it is everybody’s opinion that they are obligated, be it or certain. If most people do not keep them in storage, it is everybody’s opinion that they are free, be it or certain. Half and half you cannot consider since we have stated 2:10: “If someone finds produce on the road, if most people store it in their houses, it is free” (since, then, everybody must give heave and tithes at his barn and the few things lost on the road are included,) “if most people transport it to sell on the market, it is obligated” (since the seller may nibble from it occasionally without tithes and the future buyer, who has no relationship to the harvester, is obligated for tithes,) “half and half is .” Hence, there seems to be no way to relax the standard for a fifty-fifty doubt.: “Half and half is .” Rebbi Zeïra said, not only the easy ones for but even itself does not deal with our case, but with commercial produce; hence, it has no implications here and we may reduce the difference between R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish to this particular case.. It was stated: If one enters a town inhabited mostly by Gentiles, if there is a doubt whether the majority keep them in storage or not, everybody agrees everywhere, even outside the Land of Israel, since usually these are produce of the Land. There R. Joḥanan asserts that the requirement to treat them as equally applies to fruits bought from Gentiles or from Jews, but R. Eleazar only treats produce bought from Jews as and insists that produce bought from Gentiles is certainly not in order and one also has to give the heave. Everybody agrees with R. Meïr that Gentile ownership of land in the domain settled by the returnees from Babylonia does not free the land from the obligation of heaves and tithes, against the ruling of the Babli (cf. , Chapter 4, Notes 129–131). “Everybody” referred to here, however, are R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish, whose disagreement is explained in a second case. that they are obligated, be it or certain always for R. Joḥanan, certain for R. Eleazar if bought from a Gentile. Even these are “easy ones”, since the Gentiles certainly did not give heave and tithes; the twofold doubt which is the basis of the leniencies of , as explained in the Introduction, does not apply. There is only a single doubt, viz., whether the produce is obligated for tithes or not, and this, being of Biblical origin, must in case of doubt be resolved in a restrictive way.. If one enters a town inhabited mostly by Jews, if there is a doubt whether the majority keep them in storage or not, everybody agrees that they are free, be it or certain. If there is any doubt whether there is a majority of Gentiles or a majority of Jews, that is the disagreement between Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. These are the : Rebbi Simeon, the son of Rebbi Abba: Those appearing under the leaves. “ 1:3: “Early and late fruits in a garden are obligated; on the field they are exempt. These are the early fruits, before one appoints a watchman, the late fruits, after they folded up the mats. Rebbi Illaï said in the name of Rebbi Eliezer, the early ones are obligated because of an assumption that they are being watched.” Early and late fruits are exempt. These are the early fruits, before one appoints a watchman.” But does this depend on the watchman? Rebbi Yose said, if they are not worth the attention of a watchman. “These are the late fruits, after they folded up the mats. Rebbi Illaï said in the name of Rebbi Eliezer, the early ones are obligated because of an assumption that they are being watched..” Rebbi Yose ben Ḥalaphta said, in Sepphoris are obligated because of an assumption that they are watched. If the fig harvest was finished and he watches his field because of grapes, grape harvest and he watches his field because of vegetables, if a worker enters there and the owner is offended, they are forbidden because of robbery 3:12 and Babli 6b, but it deals with the obligation to give tithes.) By Biblical ordinance (. 23:25), a worker is entitled to eat from the produce he is harvesting. This implies that without the owner’s consent he cannot eat from produce he is not harvesting. Hence, if the owner objects to his workers going through those parts of his property that are already harvested, the owner retains all property rights to the unripe produce still standing on the field and, , the unripe produce is not abandoned, may not be taken by other people, and is not freed from the obligations of heave and tithes.. Ulla bar Ismael in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi and Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah entered to eat of late fruits; the watchman shouted at them, and Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah stopped. Rebbi told him: eat, because the owners already gave up their expectations for them! Rebbi Joḥanan asked: He shouted, and you say so of the previous paragraph bars people from taking late fruits if they are guarded. How could Rebbi permit taking these fruits?? Rebbi Jonah said, he objects rightfully. But does not a Mishnah disagree: “ 3:9. The plants mentioned are weeds used as spices. If they are close to the house and tended, they are kitchen herbs and as private property obligated for tithes. In all other circumstances, they are treated as weeds and free from heave and tithes. Calamint, hyssop, and thyme in the courtyard are obligated if they are tended.” Hence, in the garden they are free even if they are watched. There to his case., he may say, the entire world is before you, but here, there is one basketful and I am watching it for my employer. It was stated 1:1. The next sentence there reads: “But the Sages say, they are free as long as they do not ferment; once they start to ferment they are obligated.” Fermented dates are used for date wine.: “Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah says, fallen dates sold with regular dates are free. “Obligated” means that they fall under both kinds of laws. The reading “free” is in all Yerushalmi manuscripts except that of R. S. Cirillo, but the latter most probably represents an emendation by its author. In all Tosephta texts, the reading is “obligated.” Since the reading is “free” in both the Leyden and the Rome manuscripts, it must be very old. Nevertheless, it must represent a scribal error, and the reading must be “obligated;” otherwise the statement would be superfluous and contradicting the following discussion..” Is it about two boxes, one beside the other or one on top of the other? No, here we deal with a mixed bunch. Did they start to ferment or did they not start to ferment? Rebbi Mana said, we deal with fermenting ones. If they started to ferment, they should be obligated for themselves even if not mixed with good dates.! You cannot say that, since Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Sages detailed them because the majority of these kinds are collected only from abandoned property. Rebbi Ḥanina said, we deal with nonfermenting ones. If we deal with nonfermenting ones they should be free even when mixed. You cannot say that, since it was stated: “Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose said in his father’s name that a bunch of grapes of which one berry ripened, is all connected for tithes.” Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, Rebbi Zeïra and Rebbi Illaï, one adopted the first opinion, the other the second opinion. But the Sages say one does not follow either of them; those fermenting are obligated, those not fermenting are free 13:1). The statement of the Mishnah is qualified to apply only to dates that are so devoid of sugar that they do not ferment.. is . What is the difference between Judea and Galilee? Since one has a popular saying in Galilee: , (its owner should watch it), would anybody compare it to spices? That means, in Galilee it is free but in Judea it is obligated. Coriander is . What is the difference between Judea and Galilee? Since one has a popular saying in the South: Coriander is for a guide, this form means wild growing adiantum (or it may mean , pimpernel, ’, chervil, , haircap-moss, , Fumaria officinalis). is not considered cultivated., would anybody compare it to spices? That means, in Galilee it is obligated but in Judea it is free. It was stated: “Rebbi Jehudah said, in earlier times, vinegar in Judea was exempt from tithes. Since they made all their wine in purity for Temple offerings, it never got sour; they made vinegar from the skins of grapes. But now, since wine turns sour 1:2: “In earlier times, vinegar was exempt in Jehudah since it was presumed to be made from after-wine, but now it is presumed to be from wine and is obligated.”, it is obligated.” The argument of Rebbi Jehudah is inverted since we stated there 5:6.: “If one makes after-wine and puts in a given volume of water, if he finds exactly the same volume it is free, but Rebbi Jehudah obligates him..” And here he says so! Rebbi La said, in earlier times when grapes were plentiful, their skins were not counted as anything, but now that grapes are not plentiful, the skins are important. Rebbi Huna said: Rebbi Jeremiah asked, does this not contradict Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish in all these cases.? Should not all lotus fruit be more than the lotus fruit of Shiqmana, should they not be free? Rebbi Yose said, explain it at a place where most people store it. Rebbi Yose the Great asked: Is not the entire world before him, should not all lotus fruit be more than the lotus fruit of this place and be free?",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: is not subject to a fifth. 27:31). This does not apply to the Second Tithe of . or to elimination. 26:13)., it may be eaten by a strict mourner. 26:14). Since the Second Tithe of does not have the sanctity of Second Tithe, it is not deemed subject to that prohibition., it may enter Jerusalem and leave it 3:5. [According to Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, all Second Tithe may leave Jerusalem. In the Babli (‘ 54b) the prohibition is given rabbinic character only. Maimonides ( 2:9) restricts this part of the Mishnah to itself, not the Second Tithe taken from , on the basis of a discussion in tractate 3:4, as explained by the commentators of Maimonides.], and one may destroy a small part of it on the road; he may give it to the if he eats correspondingly is a person who cannot be presumed to eat his food, other than sacrifices, in ritual purity; cf. the definition of in the Introduction. The Second Tithe is not a sacrifice but nevertheless must be eaten in ritual purity (. 24:16); hence, genuine Second Tithe may not be shared with the . For the Second Tithe of , if it is too little for a meal, the owner may give that to the in preference to have it entirely wasted, but nevertheless the owner has to spend of his own money to buy pure food in the same amount to eat in purity (Maimonides 3:9)., he may redeem silver for silver, copper for copper, silver for copper. 14:25); it may not be redeemed in copper, neither may the silver be exchanged for copper. [As a matter of practice, it is permitted to exchange silver coins for gold coins to reduce their weight ( 2:7).], and copper for produce if he again redeems the produce, the words of Rebbi Meïr. But the Sages say, produce should be brought up and eaten in Jerusalem. HALAKHAH: Not following the High Priest Joḥanan who abolished the declaration of tithes 5:13: “The High Priest Joḥanan removed the declaration of tithes.” Since at the return from Babylonia the priests returned but almost no Levites came, the returnees decreed to give the First Tithe to the Cohen (who automatically also is a Levite.) The declaration of tithes, to be recited when the Second Tithe was brought to Jerusalem, is . 26:13–14: “You shall say before the Eternal, your God: I have eliminated the holy matter from my house, I gave it to the Levite (the First Tithe), the stranger, the orphan, and the widow (the Tithe of the Poor), following all Your ordinances that You commanded me, I did not transgress Your ordinances and I did not forget. I did not eat from it in my strict mourning, I did not eliminate it (by eating) in impurity, I did not give of it to the dead. I listened to the voice of the Eternal, my God, I did all that You commanded me.” The High Priest found it inappropriate to declare that tithes were given to the Levite when in fact they went to the Cohen.. He abolished the declaration but one still has to eliminate, i. e., eliminate the sure tithes. But one does not have to eliminate. It was stated: It may be eaten in strict mourning but not in impurity. What is the difference between strict mourning and impurity? Rav Naḥman said, impurity is frequent, strict mourning is infrequent. They made a decree for a frequent situation, they did not decree for an infrequent situation56b, 55a.. Rebbi Yose said, they did not even make it similar to a doubt of is defined in , Chapter 1, Note 303. Produce that may be must be treated as if the holy parts were still in it.. Since for a doubt of , whether Second Tithe was given in order, or maybe Second Tithe was not given in order, is that not forbidden for the strict mourner? But here, it is permitted to the mourner. There, we have stated‘ 3:7. The Mishnah enumerates five cases in which one has to add a fifth to the redemption money.: “Heave, the heave of the tithe, and the heave of the tithe of .” And here you say so, it would be an obvious contradiction of one Mishnah against the other.! Rebbi Zeïra said, there we have stated heave of the tithe of but here Second Tithe of . Rebbi Immi said, the Mishnah does not stop to deal with the heave of the tithe of . What is that? There it is Rebbi Meïr, but here the rabbis. Rebbi Zeïra said in the name of the rabbis: It would have been logical that for the heave of the tithe of one would not have to add a fifth as stated in the Mishnah.; why did they say that one has to add a fifth? Because of a fence for it 1:1). Babylonian גזירה “rabbinic ordinance” is a derivative of Galilean גדירה “fence”, for ð., for if you tell him that he does not have to add, he will not treat it as holy. It would have been logical that for the Second Tithe of one would have to add a fifth; why did they say that one does not have to add a fifth? Because of a fence for it, for if you tell him that he has to add, he will not separate it at all, in contrast to the First Tithe and the tithe of the poor, since the Second Tithe will not burden the buyer. Anything that makes it burdensome (and, in the absence of the Temple, when the coin used for redemption has to be destroyed, also costly) will cause people to ignore their duty.. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi La: Why and not also what is certain., why a little bit, maybe the greater part? Did we not state: One does not bring the heave from the threshing floor to town, nor from the prairie to cultivated land, except in a place where [an animal] would drag it away; in that case he brings it and takes money from the tribe.. He said to him, is it not a commandment to return a find? Rebbi Yose said, it is a commandment to return a find in small matters; it is not a commandment to return in large matters, except if it is certain; it is not a commandment to return since we have stated: “one may destroy a small part of it on the road”. So far, if he had no money in hand. If he had money in hand? Rebbi Neḥumai, the son of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, said, my father had money in a double sack p. 319. and he did not redeem. It turns out that Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba holds with Rebbi Zeïra to go to waste, he explains the Mishnah here to refer exclusively to Second Tithe. Since in the times of R. Ḥiyya bar Abba heave already had to be burned because all Cohanim were ritually impure in the absence of the ashes of the red heifer, the reference could not possibly be to heave. and Rebbi Aḥa by the duty of conserving other people’s property in the same way as something found. Hence, R. La accepts that the Mishnah here also speaks of the heave of the tithe of , as proposed by R. Immi. with Rebbi Immi. In the house of Rebbi Yannai they said, if it is in crumbs one is permitted to waste in amounts less than a meal, but whole foods only up to the volume of a dried fig. Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of R. Simeon ben Yoẓadaq: If it is whole, up to the volume of a dried fig, in crumbs any amount. Is that their difference? Rebbi Mana said, is not the following their difference: In the house of Rebbi Yannai they said, if it is in crumbs one is permitted to waste in amounts less than a meal, whole foods only up to the volume of a dried fig. Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of R. Simeon ben Yoẓadaq, whether it be whole or in crumbs, up to the volume of a dried fig. Rebbi Hoshaia asked: May one allow a small amount to go to waste or does he have the right to directly throw it away? (R. Eliahu Fulda and his followers change לאבד into להפריש, “to separate”, but this emendation is unnecessary.) Since the question is not answered it should be answered in the negative (Maimonides 3:9, with concurrence of R. Abraham ben David.)? One may give it to the and eat from accordingly. But not for certain food, since one does not hand over certain food to the .",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who buys as seeds or animal fodder, flour for tanning, oil for lighting, or oil to rub on vessels, since rubbing on is everywhere equated to drinking., is free from . From Akhzib and further he is free from . of the , food containing heave. 22:28., food bought with money of the Second Tithe, and the remainders of flour sacrifices was never intended as it would make no sense. are free from . Sweet oil, the House of Shammai declare it obligated but the House of Hillel declare it free. HALAKHAH: Since he bought it as seeds there is no difference whether it is something of which the seed disappears or something of which the seed does not disappear 9:5).. Rebbi Johanan said, we have stated this 1:18, the first part of the statement discussed in the next paragraph.: “If he bought as seeds and then changed his mind to use them for consumption, they enter by his thought. by thought. If he bought for consumption and then changed his mind to use them as seeds, not all is from him but cannot remove it..” It was stated 1:18: “One does not sow , nor does one cover ; one does not work with a Gentile. A Jew who forgot and sowed , before it sprouted he is obligated, after it sprouted he is free because it already is lost.” The language of the Yerushalmi (Rome ms.) is preferable; since if one does not work on with a Gentile, it is obvious that one cannot do it alone. [Maimonides ( 3:6) omits the mention of the Gentile, possibly because of the two contradictory sources.]: One does not sow , one may not cover , but one covers with a Gentile. If one forgot and sowed , he is free, for it is already lost if it is something that usually is not collected; but for something that usually is collected, he is fined to collect it before it sprouts. But if it sprouted, it turns into something that usually is not collected. They said that Rebbi Joḥanan was putting in order was used in cooking, he gave heave of the tithe and redeemed the Second Tithe for everything. “Putting in order” everywhere means giving heave and tithes to permit the food for consumption. everything he ate, even red meat, even an egg. His students said to him: Did our teacher not teach us (. 14:22): “You shall certainly tithe all the yield of your field.” He was worried about the fluids in it. Rebbi Jeremiah sent Rebbi Zeïra a basket of figs that were not put in order. Rebbi Jeremiah said to himself, would Rebbi Zeïra eat anything that was not put in order? Rebbi Zeïra said to himself, it is impossible that Rebbi Jeremiah would send me anything that was not put in order. In the meantime, was eaten. The next day, when he was with him, he asked him: Was that basket you sent me put in order? He answered him, I said, would Rebbi Zeïra eat anything that was not put in order? He answered, I also said, would Rebbi Jeremiah send me anything that was not put in order is automatically put in order by the rules of ; this story extends the duty of to food from the observant unless there is a declaration.? Rebbi Abba bar Zemina said in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: If the earlier generations were angels, we are men; if they were men, we are donkeys 112b. The parallel is fol. 48c, Midrash 60.. Rebbi Mana said, at that moment was eaten and nobody suspected that it was not in order. they said, we are not even comparable to the she-ass of Rebbi Phineas ben Yaïr. Thieves stole the she-ass of Rebbi Phineas ben Yaïr at night. She was hidden with them for three days during which she did not eat anything. After three days, they took counsel to return her to her master. They said, let us send her to her master lest she die with us and foul up the cave. They let her out; she stood at her master’s door and started braying. He said to them, open to that poor creature because for three days now she did not taste anything. They opened for her and she entered. He said to them, give her something to eat. They put oats before her but she did not eat. They said to him, rabbi, she does not want to eat. He asked them, did you put it in order? They said: Yes. He asked them, did you remove its ? They said, did the rabbi not teach us: “He who buys for seeds or animals, flour for tanning, oil for lighting, or oil to rub vessels, is free from .” He said to them, what can we do with this poor creature since she is very restrictive for herself 7a/b; the first part of the story is told of the she-ass of R. Ḥanina ben Dosa in , Version 1, end of Chapter 8. Both stories are referred to in Babli 112b. The Yerushalmi version is also in 60.? They removed the and she ate. Two poor people entrusted two of barley to Rebbi Phineas ben Yaïr; he sowed them and harvested them. They came to him and wanted to take their barley. He said to them, bring camels and donkeys to carry their barley 3(4). There, he replanted the crop for seven years.. Rebbi Phineas ben Yaïr went to a place where they came to him and said, rats are eating our grain. He commanded them; they assembled and started to whistle. He asked them, do you understand what they are saying? They said, no. He said to them, they say that it is not put in order. They said to him, be our guarantor. He promised and they had no further losses. A pearl of the king of Saracens fell and was swallowed by a rat. He came to Rebbi Phineas ben Yaïr, who said to him, am I a sorcerer? He answered, I came because of your good name. He commanded them; they assembled. He saw one coming that was hunchbacked. He said, it is in this one; he gave the rat a command and it spat out the pearl. Rebbi Phineas ben Yaïr went to a place where they came to him and said, our water source is not sufficient for us. He said to them, perhaps you do not put in order? They said to him, be our guarantor. He promised them and it became sufficient for them. Rebbi Phineas ben Yaïr went to the House of Assembly when Ginai 7a, probably . overflowed. He said: Ginai, Ginai, why do you prevent me from going to the House of Assembly? It split before him and he crossed it. His students asked him, may we cross also? He said to them, he who knows of himself that he never slighted a Jew may cross and will not be harmed. Rebbi wanted to permit the Sabbatical year 4:2, Babli 26a, cf. Rashi there.) The parallel to the entire story is in 3:1.. Rebbi Phineas ben Yaïr went to him. He said to him: how is the grain doing? He answered him: endives are doing fine. He said to him: how is the grain doing? He answered him: endives are doing fine. From this, Rebbi understood that he did not agree with him. He said to him: Would the rabbi care to eat a bite with me today? He said to him, yes. When he came, he saw the she-mules 8:5, it is stated that a white mule’s kick is life-threatening. Hence, white mules should not be kept by Jews. of Rebbi standing. He said, are all these fed by Jews? He will not see me again! They went and told this to Rebbi. Rebbi sent and wanted to pacify him. They found him in his city. He said, the people of my city should come close to me. The people of his city came and surrounded him. They said to them, Rebbi wants to make peace with him. They left him and went away. He said, my cousins: “My sons.” should come close to me. Fire descended from Heaven and surrounded him. They returned and told Rebbi. He said, since we did not have merit to eat our fill from him in this world, may we be worthy to eat our fill from him in the World to Come. Rebbi Ḥaggai in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman 5:2 and in slightly different form in Midrash 3.: It happened that a pious person used to dig cisterns, ditches, and caves for travellers. Once, his daughter travelled to marry and she was swept away by a river. All people came to him and wanted to console him, but he refused to be consoled. Rebbi Phineas ben Yaïr came to him and wanted to console him, but he refused to be consoled. He told them, is that your pious man? They said to him: Rabbi, such and such he did, such and such happened to him. He replied: It is impossible that he would honor his Creator by water and He hurts him by water! Immediately, there started a rumor in the town that the pious man’s daughter had returned. Some say, she got trapped in a hedge of thorns, others say that an angel came in the appearance of Rebbi Phineas ben Yaïr and saved her. Rebbi Ḥanina ben Dosa was sitting down to eat on Friday night when the table sank before him. They said to him, what is that? She said to him, I borrowed spices from my neighbor and forgot to give tithes and to 87b. from it. He mentioned a condition during the twilight hours of Friday night (Mishnah 2:6). The story is inserted to show that a just person will not stumble unwittingly over a prohibition. and the table rose by itself. Rebbi Tarphon sat down to eat when he dropped his bread. They asked him, what is this? He said to them, I borrowed an axe and I prepared food in purity with it. “ 1:24. There, the text continues: “If one buys wine and oil to put on abscesses, black peas to make powder, they are subject to but R. Simeon ben Eleazar declares it free.” Wine for brine,, shortened from Greek ἁλμυρίς, ίδος, ἡ, “salty thing; salt land; saltiness” (E. G.)., wine for perfume, cf. pp. 87, 510. According to the Babli ( 140 a) a mixture of olive oil, wine, and balsamum., legumes to make into powder are subject to , not to mention if they are certain. They themselves are free from .” Where are we standing? According to Rebbi, they should be subject to , according to Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon, even if certain they should be free 11:1 (fol. 47c) “Wine of {heave} to use for brine, Rebbi permits it {since the wine remains wine}, R. Eleazar ben R. Simeon forbids it {since it is a use of the heave not for direct consumption.} Hence, Rebbi forbids such brine for non-Cohanim {since the sanctity of the heave permeates all}, R. Simeon ben Eleazar permits it to non-Cohanim {since the wine has disappeared.}” Here also, if the wine etc. has disappeared, and if brine bought on the market is not subject to , for R. Eleazar ben R. Simeon even wine bought expressly for the production of brine cannot be subject to .. But we follow Rebbi, we say we are dealing with the easy ones, for which they eased the rules of . “Wine for eye medication 1:25 reads: “He who buys wine to put into eye medication or flour to put into wound dressing, is free from and obligated if it is certain. They themselves are free from .” It seems that this is a Babylonian text., flour to make into wound dressing, are obligated if they are certain and one does not have to mention that they are under the rules of . They themselves are free if certain.” Here you say, free if certain, and there you say, free from . Here it disappears by itself, there it disappears when used. Did we not state: “Eye medication from a pagan temple is forbidden to use?” There is a difference, since it is written (. 13:16): “Nothing banned should stick to your hands.” What is the difference between this and grape skins from Gentiles? Are these not also forbidden to use? But dried skins are not forbidden because of idolatrous use 2:4, skins remaining after pressing grapes for wine are forbidden to use if moist but not if completely dry. The question is not answered, probably because the answer is obvious: totally dry eye medication is unusable.. “ From Akhzib and further on it is free from .” What is the status of Akhzib itself? It was stated (Tosephta 1:4): “Akhzib itself is free from .” “He who buys from a donkey caravan at Tyre and from the chest 13:6). at Sidon is obligated 1:10, the statement is inverted: “He who buys from a donkey caravan at Tyre and from the chest at Sidon is free, from the chest at Tyre and the donkey caravan at Sidon is obligated. R. Yose ben R. Jehudah says, he who buys from the chest at Tyre is free, and certainly from the donkey caravan. From one donkey driver at Tyre he is obligated. R. Jehudah says, the donkey caravan that descends to Akhzib is obligated because it may be assumed that it comes from Galilee. {If it “descends”, it comes either from Galilee or from Tyre.} But the Sages say, it is in its prior state, free until you have ascertained from where it comes.”.” Hence, from the donkey caravan at Sidon and from the chest at Tyre it is free. From a single donkey at Tyre 13:6).. A donkey caravan that entered Tyre through Akhzib? Come and see, if it were standing at Akhziv it would be free, now that it entered Tyre would it be obligated? Rebbi Joḥanan said: When they decreed , they did not decree about these matters of the , food containing heave, food bought with money of the Second Tithe, and the remainders of flour sacrifices are free from ” were never included in a duty of ; there is no need for an explanation why these are excluded.. Rebbi Hoshaia said, the fear of sacred things is on him and he will not give to the Cohen anything that is not in order even if the original decree did not mention this exclusion.. “ of the ,” according to R. Hoshaia, the Mishnah deals with the of an . But a who bought dough from an and gave is not covered, since his case is not mentioned in the Mishnah.. According to R. Joḥanan, the two cases are identical. “And food containing heave,” according to R. Hoshaia, the Mishnah deals with produce of an . But if a bought produce from an and it became mixed with heave, he is not covered. According to R. Joḥanan, the two cases are identical. What is the difference between them? One that was lifted from among 100 ., according to R. Joḥanan it is obligated, according to R. Hoshaia it is free. It was stated: “All of these., if he gave a name to their heave of the tithe or Second Tithe, what he did is done. 1:28 which, however, as noted by R. S. Lieberman, deals exclusively with matters of the Temple and, therefore, excludes the heave of the tithe.” According to R. Joḥanan, this is fine. According to R. Hoshaia, they are in order, and you say so? Because of one who is unscrupulous about sacred things. It was stated was found expressing the last argument.: “All of these, if he gave a name to their heave of the tithe or Second Tithe, what he did is done, because of one who does not put in order.” Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked or also includes regular tithe. The answer is that all tithe money is exempt (R. Simson.) before Rebbi Ze'ira: So far with money of tithes of ? Even if it is certain! It 2:8, fol. 63a, which is its main place. was stated: “All of these, if he gave a name to their heave of the tithe or Second Tithe, what he did is done.” Rebbi Eleazar said, with the exception of the remainders of flour sacrifices. Rebbi Jeremiah said, the rest is in dispute. Rebbi Yose asked, what dispute? Where are we standing, if according to Rebbi Meïr 2:8: “If a priest marries by his share in the holiest sacrifices or simple holy sacrifices, the marriage is not valid. With Second Tithes, be it with or without knowledge, the marriage is not valid, the words of R. Meïr. Rebbi Jehudah said, if in error, the marriage is not valid, if with knowledge, the marriage is valid.” In order to marry, the groom has to give the bride something valuable of his property while declaring before two witnesses that by accepting the gift she is married to him (cf. Chapter 6, Note 46). Rebbi Meïr declares that holiest sacrifices, the Cohen’s share of simple sacrifices, and the Second Tithe are all Heaven’s property offered, as the case may be, to the Cohen, his family, or the layman and his family for consumption in Jerusalem. Hence, for R. Meïr, the basic conditions for a valid marriage are not satisfied., both for tithes and for the remainders of flour sacrifices, he did not do anything. If according to Rebbi Jehudah, Chapter 7, Note 135., what he did is done. Rebbi Mana said, I went to Caesarea and heard Rebbi Ḥizqiah who was sitting there, stating: “If a priest marries by means of his share in the holiest sacrifices or simple holy sacrifices, the marriage is not valid.” Rebbi Eleazar said, that is everybody’s opinion. Rebbi Joḥanan said, it is in dispute. I said to him, from whom did the rabbi hear this, and he said, from Rebbi Jeremiah. I said, this explains the matter! Rebbi Jeremiah, who heard that Rebbi Eleazar said, it is everybody’s opinion, he says it is in dispute to .. Rebbi Yose, who did not hear that, asked which dispute? If according to Rebbi Meïr, both for Second Tithe and for the remainders of flour sacrifices, he did not do anything, if according to Rebbi Jehudah, what he did is done. It was stated1:26–27. As R. S. Lieberman points out, it follows that putting some (not too much) natural perfume in oil does not make the oil unfit for human consumption even though it is destined for rubbing into the skin.: Rebbi Jehudah said, the House of Hillel freed only spikenard oil, cf. Pliny, . XIII, 2.. Others say in the name of Rebbi Nathan, the House of Hillel obligated oil perfumed with rose or iris.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: With , one may make (“mixing”) on the Sabbath. If many houses open into a common courtyard, in order to carry from the houses to the courtyard it is necessary to turn the courtyard into common property. This is done by putting into the courtyard some food to which all houses contributed. The second kind is “mixing of domains”, explained in , Chapter 8, Note 56., participate in giving food for a common meal. Since the rules for the dead-end street are different from those for a courtyard, the word is not used., recite grace wine has not been put in order and one wants to use it for the cup of blessing. If a transgression of a Biblical commandment were involved, using it for a benediction would constitute blasphemy., and recite grace in a group. One may separate it while naked does not require a benediction and no invocation of the Name, and, hence, may be separated while one is naked (Cf. Halakhah 8:2). or at twilight which in any case is food of the poor, may be put in order during twilight (Mishnah 2:7).. And if one lifted the Second Tithe before the First, it is also acceptable. The oil the weaver puts on his hands 2:7: “If it is doubtful whether it is night or not, one does not tithe the certain, one does not immerse vessels (to remove impurity), one does not kindle lights, but one may tithe , make an , and cover warm food (to keep it warm for the next morning.)” is obligated for , that which the carder puts on wool is free from . HALAKHAH: One may separate it while naked because it does not need a benediction. Around twilight, that is what we have stated 2:7: “If it is doubtful whether it is night or not, one does not tithe the certain, one does not immerse vessels (to remove impurity), one does not kindle lights, but one may tithe , make an , and cover warm food (to keep it warm for the next morning.)”: “If it is doubtful whether it is night or not.” Rebbi Ḥalaphta ben Shaul stated: One may redeem in the bathhouse since it does not need a benediction. Hence, if the produce is certain it needs a benediction. Rebbi Mana asked before Rebbi Judan, what does he recite? If it was produce, “on the redemption of Second Tithe,” if it was money, “on turning Second Tithe profane.” “If one lifted the Second Tithe before the First, it is also acceptable.” Hence, one should not do it on purpose. Rebbi Abba, son of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, one may make the Second precede the First in 9:6, even though for practical decisions one prefers R. Joshua ben Levi over R. Joḥanan, probably because the practical rule which the Halakhah gives, in the paragraph following the next, works only according to R. Joḥanan.. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa bar Idi in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: One should not do it, but if he did, what he did is valid. May one determine the Second in place of the First but about produce from which no tithes were taken. It is forbidden to change the order in which the tithes are to be taken; if one takes the Second before the First, one may not recite in the Temple the declaration of tithes, containing the assertion ( 26:13); “I did not overstep Your commandments.” Here, the question is whether this also applies simply to the designation of the place from which the tithe will be taken in the future. This is important if somebody wants to consume fruits or wine for which he will give tithes in the future from some other batch, under circumstances that prevent the actual separation now, e. g., on the Sabbath. Then he must spell out the location from which tithes will be taken. Does this preliminary determination also have to follow the strict rules of precedence?? His sharecropper brought fruits to Rebbi Yose ben Shaul. He said to him, go and fix a place for the Second. He returned, and he told him, go and fix a place for the First. Should he not worry that maybe the Second was fixed at a place reserved for the First? This means that it is permitted to determine the Second in place of the First. Ulla bar Ismael in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: A person may free his denotes produce from which nothing yet was given but, as R. Abraham ben David points out in his notes to Maimonides, 7:3, one must assume that heave already was taken; otherwise, the entire operation would be impossible. with one of . How does he do it? He brings one of and declares it to be Second (Tithe), redeems it for the First Tithe only and can be used as First Tithe or as heave of the tithe. Since this Second Tithe is different from the produce to be tithed, no transgression was committed in designating the Second Tithe first., and returns to make it heave of the tithe for any other place. Ulla descended there and said this in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, but they united against him. Rav Sheshet objected, does not a Mishnah contradict: “If there were before him two baskets full of figs 7:6: “If he had before him two baskets of ; if he said, the tithes of one of them are in the other, the tithes of the first one are given. Of the first in the second and of the second in the first, the tithes of the first one are given. The tithes of each of the baskets are in the other one, he named them correctly.” In the second case, the second basket is not in order since the first basket is in order and one may under no circumstances give tithes from produce from which tithes were already given. In the third case, however, the fixing of the places of tithes is simultaneous for both baskets and that is possible since it was permitted in the first case (and we have established that there is no sin in giving names or fixing places simultaneously as long as the actual lifting of the tithes is done in good order.).” And we have stated about this 8:15: “If two baskets of were before him, each containing 100 figs, if their heave was taken and the tithes of each, the first gives its tithes. If he takes the tithes of each from the other, the first does not give tithes (as explained in the previous note). He takes two figs, two tithes, and a tenth of a tenth.” If he takes the tithes from each basket, he takes from each basket 19 figs (10 for First Tithe, 9 for Second Tithe, since heave was already taken.) If he takes all tithes from one basket, he takes 20 for First Tithe, 16 for Second Tithe. Hence, he has to add another 2 figs to get to the required 38 figs. Then from the First Tithe, he takes one tenth as heave of the tithe.: “He takes from the second basket two figs and two tenths, and a tenth of a tenth.” Why can he not take two figs, declare them to be Second (Tithe), redeem them, and return to make them heave of the tithe for any other place? Rebbi Mana said, is not the Second Tithe in the first basket containing First Tithe of the second basket? Rebbi Ḥananiah said, there it is for the First and Second. But here, Second Tithe that was put in order after First, can you return and make it First? “The oil that the weaver puts on his hands is obligated for , that which the carder puts on wool is free from .” What is the difference between one case and the other? The first disappears on his body, the latter disappears on the wool.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: The following must be tithed as everywhere: Fig cakes, dates, carobs, rice, and cumin. Rice from outside the Land even if imported and used in the land occupied by the returnees from Babylonia. is free for everybody who uses it. HALAKHAH: There, we have stated 4:8. All these kinds are not subject to tithes since they are not produced in the Land of Israel.: “Garlic from Baalbek, onions from Rikhpah, split beans from Cilicia, and Egyptian lentils.” Because these kinds also grow in the Land of Israel, the Sages had to attach marks to them. “But filberts, pistachios, and pine nuts, since these kinds do not grow in the Land of Israel, the Sages did not have to attach marks to them. 4:10, from a statement of R. Yose. There (in all Tosephta manuscripts) it is implied that these nuts are also produced in the Land of Israel, but Baalbek onions etc. do not grow in the Land. R. Isaac ben Malchisedek Simponti notes that he has Yerushalmi manuscripts of both traditions.” Rebbi Abun said, the Mishnah is the opposite regarding the obligation of these kinds; since these kinds do not grow outside of the Land, the Sages had to enumerate them even outside the Land, in contrast to the first Mishnah which enumerated the kinds exempt from even if grown in the Land.. But is there not fig cake from Bosra? It is pounded. But dates from Alexandria? They are thin. But carob from Kiari? It is cut. But rice from the Ḥolata? It has more numerous kernels and is reddish. But cumin from Cyprus? It is curved. Rebbi Lazar said, they stated the Mishnah only for him who buys from a Gentile, but for him who buys from a Jew it is , if the text is allowed to stand there would be no difference between R. Eleazar and R. Joḥanan. So either R. Eleazar must say that produce of a Gentile is certain and only that of a Jew is (following R. Meïr who declares that a Gentile cannot acquire arable land in the Land of Israel to exempt it from heave and tithes) or that the produce of the Jew is certain and that of the Gentile is . The second version is impossible since only a Jew will be expected to give heave and tithes but not a Gentile. In light of the following it is also impossible to assume that the Gentile is only the seller, not the producer. So only the first possibility remains. (Since practice follows R. Joḥanan, as indicated in the next paragraph, the problem is not mentioned in Maimonides and we do not know his reading.). Rebbi Joḥanan said, there is no difference, whether one buys from a Jew or from a Gentile it is . Rebbi Eleazar holds that most of the Land of Israel is in the hands of the Gentiles. Rebbi Joḥanan holds that most of the Land of Israel is in the hands of Jews. But even if Rebbi Eleazar agrees with Rebbi Joḥanan that most of the Land of Israel is in the hands of Jews, Rebbi Eleazar is anxious about a minority. Like that fortification p. 663). In the Babli it appears as כרך. The garrison in the palisades is Gentile and lives off the , a tax to be paid in agricultural products. They will sell their surplus; if all surroundings are Jewish, one buys their surplus as if it were Jewish produce, but not if some of the farmers sending their to the garrison are Gentiles. Then a testimony that one day the supply came from a Gentile source makes all their surplus subject to all tithes for him who holds that produce grown by a Gentile in the Land is subject to heave and tithes., if for one day it got supplies from a forbidden source, that day will become proof for all days. Rebbi Yose asked: If that is so, a prospective proselyte who comes to convert should not be accepted. 23:4. Since practice rules this out, according to Mishnah 4:4, every male proselyte is permitted to marry a Jewish woman and the alternative reason given for R. Eleazar is unacceptable.; I say he is from Ammon and Moab, and one proselyte would become proof for all proselytes. Hence, Rebbi Eleazar must hold that most of the Land of Israel is in the hands of Gentiles and Rebbi Joḥanan must hold that most of the Land of Israel is in the hands of Jews. Moreover from the following: Rebbi Zeïra sent to ask Rebbi Alexander from Ẓedoqa, those Nicolaus dates from here, what you estimate about them, mostly from Gentiles or mostly from Jews? He said to him, we are not able to estimate about them. One statement supports this and a second statement supports Rebbi Eleazar. “The trader’s produce everywhere is . When is that? If most of his supply is from Jews. But if he buys from Gentiles, it is certain.” A statement supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “Rebbi Neḥemiah stated: “Whether from a Gentile, a Jewish Samaritan 3:1, fol. 27a) against Rebbi; cf. also Chapter 3, Note 98. A Samaritan observes all Biblical laws. However, since his brand of Judaism was adopted by the Sadducees, we know that he takes the verse (. 19:14): “Do not put an obstacle before a blind man” literally, not as a general injunction not to trap the unwary; he will not take heave and tithes from his harvest for sale. His produce is certainly subject to all the laws if we accept Samaritans as Jews., or an seller, if at times he buys from the Gentile, at times from the Jew, it is .” Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada asked before Rebbi Mana: From whom did this man buy? If from a Jew it is , from a Gentile certain. Explain that if the trader was a Gentile and both Jew and Gentile deliver to him, it is . Rav Hoshaia objected, does not the Mishnah support Rebbi Joḥanan? As it was stated 17:5. Badan () and Geba were places in Samaria (Tosephta 6:10). While these varieties were mainly grown in Samaria, some were grown by Jews. But since the Jews were a minority among the Samaritans, the produce must be treated as Samaritan, subject to tithes but certainly not tithed.: “Rebbi Jehudah said, they only mentioned pomegranates from Badan and grain from Geba because they must be tithed as certain everywhere.” What are we talking about? If he bought from a Jew, can it be pronounced certain? But we must deal with a Gentile. Hence, all other things are tithed as . Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, we deal with certain produce from a Jew. Explain it that there was a powerful overseer of markets who exerted pressure to sell at low prices, and they permitted him to sell and let the buyer beware for himself. Who is a trader supporting R. Eleazar.? Everyone who brought, repeated, and came a third time. Rebbi Jonah asked, if he brought three loads together, is he not a trader; one after the other, is he a trader? Rebbi Jonah asked, does he become a trader retroactively or only for the future? What is the difference? If someone came and brought his things in order, if you say only for the future, can he tithe from one on the other. Once he is a trader, one cannot tithe one for another since the one chosen may have been in order and the tithing is invalid. If the title of trader is not retroactive, he may give from the certain also for the . The question is not answered.! Rebbi Mana asked: Can he, his son, and his worker combine for three loads? Rebbi Jonah asked, a ship that comes from Rome and carries many kinds, do you count this only as one? “For fruits they did not consider either smell, or looks, or taste, or value, but only plurality 4:11. If fruits are mixed the obligations of tithes follow the status of the group which forms a plurality..” Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If it was wine, for example new wine and old wine, they judged according to taste. Rebbi Mana said, I went to Caesarea, Caesarea in the Yerushalmi is usually Caesarea Philippi near the source of the Jordan river. Caesarea here is Caesarea maritima, whose leading authority was R. Isaac ben Eleazar. The Land in which all duties on produce are due is the land occupied by the returnees from Babylonia, Judea and Galilee, and, if we accept Samaritans as Jews, their land, Samaria. In the plain East of Samaria, the region between the connecting Damascus and Egypt and the sea was mostly malaria swamps, except for the healthy strip between the first dunes and the sea. Herod built an elevated highway from the to the sea, where he built Caesarea maritima for a Gentile population, separate from the Jewish centers. Hence, the region of Caesarea and its sand marshes never fell under the laws attached to the Land. and I saw them using fig cake as free. I asked Rebbi Isaac bar Eleazar; he said to me that Zeugos used to permit it. Rebbi Isaac bar Eleazar in the name of Zeugos of Caesarea: All that sees the water is free. Some want to say, up to the salt tower, some want to say, up to the Telamon cave. Rebbi Abba Mari said, the words of the rabbis imply that all kinds are forbidden in Caesarea. “Wheat, bread, oil, dates, rice, and cumin whose end is quoted later in the paragraph. The implication is that only these products are because they are imported; all others are free, since it does not simply say: everything in Caesarea is . In the synagogue mosaic from Reḥov, the text reads: הפירות הללו מתעסרין דמיי בקסרין החטין והפת חלה לעולם והיין והשמן והתמרין והאורז והכמן הרי אלו מותרין בשביעית בקסרין ובישאר שני שבוע הן מתקנין דמיי ויש אוסרין בולבסין הלבנין מהר המלך. “The following produce is tithed as in Cesarea: Wheat (bread always needs ), wine, oil, dates, rice, and cumin; these are permitted in the Sabbatical year, in the other years they must be fixed as . Some authorities forbid white bulbs (onions) from King’s Mountain.”.” Fig cakes are not included? It is in the Mishnah “everywhere.” The sentence is the answer to the preceding question.. But we have also mentioned rice and cumin; these are in the Mishnah and we have spelled them out! Those are the ones which are left out. “These are permitted in the Sabbatical year, in all other years of the Sabbatical cycle they are .” These are permitted in the Sabbatical year; why are they not Sabbatical fruits in the Sabbatical year? The Jews treat them as Sabbatical, the Gentiles are free, Jews and Gentiles outnumber Samaritans; Gentile produce is because maybe it is locally grown and exempt; this outnumbers the produce that may be certain if produced by Samaritans.. In all other years of the Sabbatical cycle they are , the Judean Jews put them in order, Gentiles are free, Jews and Gentiles outnumber Samaritans. How far? The inn of the pillars 45, 54–63) concludes from the last sentence that the principle of applying the Laws of the Land to the territory held by the returnees from Babylonia meant that any real estate ever held by a Jew within the territory of Biblical Israel after the return is forever subject to the Laws of the Land., the inn at Tayibeh North of Kefar Saba (which probably was near modern Juljulia), which in its turn was North of Antipatris, the Northern border fortress of Judea., as far as Kefar Saba. Their juices are certain in Caesarea. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina: bulbs (onions) sold in Cesarea are forbidden because most of them come from King’s Mountain. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada said, the white ones, but the rabbis of Cesarea say, the red ones. Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi permitted Beth Shean 6b), the reading is that R. Meïr ate a leaf of vegetable without tithing for the same kind of argument. on the testimony of Joshua ben Zeruz, the son of Rebbi Meïr’s father-in-law, who said, I saw Rebbi Meïr buy vegetables from a garden in the Sabbatical year. He permitted all of it! Rebbi Zeïra said, this implies that nobody should act in public; I say that this garden was a particular case for him; should he have permitted it completely? Rebbi permitted Beth Shean, permitted Caesarea, permitted Bet Guvrin, permitted Kefar Ẓemaḥ. Rebbi permitted to buy vegetables after the end of the Sabbatical year 6:4, Tosephta 4:17. The reason is detailed in 7:4, note 81. and all were saying bad things about him. He said to them, come and let us discuss the matter. It is written ( 18:4): “He. 21:9), because the people worshipped it as a divinity. The argument given here is also in Babli 6a. smashed the brass snake.” Was there no just person between Moses and Hezekiah to remove it? But the Holy One, praise to Him, reserved that crown to him so he could crown himself with it. We also had this crown reserved by the Holy One, praise to Him, to crown ourselves with it. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi commanded his lads: Do not buy me vegetables except from Sisera’s garden. He, may he be remembered for the good stood nearby and said to him: Go tell your teacher that this is not Sisera’s garden; it did belong to a Jew but he killed him and took it away from him. If you want to be restrictive for yourself, permit it to your friend. Rebbi Yose of Kefar Dan in the name of Rebbi from Meadiah, the kinds forbidden in Beth Shean: Green melon, water melon and sweet melon, mint {Greek μίνθα, μίνθη, Latin menta,} bundled separately, Egyptian beans bundled with bast, leeks from Shavuot to Hanukkah, seeds of nigella, sesame, mustard, rice, cumin, dry lupines, large peas sold by measure {cf. Mishnah 3:2}, garlic, local onions, βολβός {perhaps truffles}, Ephesian dates; wine and oil are Sabbatical produce in the Sabbatical year, in the other years . Bread always needs .”: Nigella, sesame, mustard, garlic, bulbs, black peas, commercial onions, local ones that are sold by weight, Egyptian beans bound with bast, mint bundled separately, carrot”. always, leeks., called , corresponding to Greek κεφαλωτός [Pliny XX. 6. 22]; cf. p. 484. from Pentecost to Ḥanukkah. Rebbi Zeïra said, from Pentecost to Ḥanukkah the forbidden ones outnumber the permitted ones, from Ḥanukkah to Pentecost the permitted ones outnumber the forbidden ones. In the matter of aftergrowth. 25:5,11)., from New Year’s Day to Ḥanukkah prohibition of aftergrowth, from Ḥanukkah to Pentecost permission of aftergrowth, from Pentecost to New Year’s Day questionable. Zucchini, squash, water melon, apple melon, Greek μηλοπέπων. The modern meaning of the word, “cucumber”, is found in Maimonides and (ed. Luncz, Jerusalem 1899 p. 485), see Mishnah 1:2. The identification of all these fruits from the family is tentative; see the detailed discussion in the commentary to Mishnah 1:2., wine, oil, Ephesian dates, somebody also says lupines. Bread always requires is an obligation of the Land (Mishnah 2:1), but by rabbinical ordinance it has to be taken everywhere (Mishnah 4:8). It seems from the repeated insistence on the obligation to give in the Yerushalmi and the mosaic from Reḥov that this rabbinic ordinance was not generally observed by the population of districts outside the holdings of the returnees from Babylonia.. These are Sabbatical in a Sabbatical year. In the other years of the cycle? Rebbi Jonah said, ; Rebbi Yose said, certain. They have no disagreement over tithes; Rebbi Jonah said for him who buys from a person making house calls, cf. Arabic בלנקע “paved road.” The produce bought on the road is of uncertain origin., Rebbi Yose said certain for him who bought from the garden. How far) gate (πύλη) to the white smooth place (the shale rocks at the foot of the Gilboa mountains). In the West, from the Ziara gate to the end of the paved road. In the North, from the Sakota gate to Kefar Qarnos (quoted in . 17 as grazing place of Job’s cattle; ms. Rome also reads קרנוס); Kefar Qarnos has the status of Beth Shean. In the East, from the dung gate to the mausoleum of Panokatia (?), the gates of Kefar Zimrin and the pond gate; inside the gate it is permitted, outside it is forbidden.”? (The cross roads of , the mausoleum of and Kefar Karnaim, Kefar Karnaim being like Beth Shean.) Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Zachariah: The kinds forbidden in Paneas: Rice, walnuts, sesame, Egyptian beans; some also say early ripening . These have sabbatical status in the Sabbatical year, in the remaining years they must be tithed as certain, even outside the Upper Rooster.” The identity of “complete ” and “certain” is discussed by R. S. Lieberman in 45 (5776), 54–63. He quotes several passages in which “certain” means “to be treated as certain because of doubt.”: Walnuts, rice, sesame, and Egyption beans. Gamliel the twin says, early ripening 6:2, Note 125.. Rebbi Jonah said, that means, higher than the Rooster of Caesarea 6:1, fol. 36c), one of the border marks is “the Upper Rooster over Cesarea Philippi”; from there to the Northeast is the Trachonitis and Syria, to the Southwest is the Holy Land.. But below the Rooster of Caesarea it has the status of the Land of Israel. Rebbi Jonah asked: If his field was sown with vegetables and he came and found it full of rice, is the vegetable permitted and the rice forbidden? If the rice is high and the vegetable low, is the vegetable permitted and the rice forbidden? In fact, most of these fields produce these species! Even if you say that most of these fields produce these species, most of these kinds only come from forbidden areas. It was stated: The rice in the sands of Antiochia is permitted in its place. Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yose permitted it as far as . Rebbi Jonah asked: This distance in every direction? “The following are the forbidden towns in the district of Tyre 4:9. The text of the Reḥov mosaic reads: העיירות האסורות בתחום צור שצת ובצת ופי מצובה וחנותה עלייתה וחנותה ארעייתה וביברה וראש מייה ואמון ומזה היא קסטלה וכל מה שקנו ישראל נאסר.. “The towns forbidden in the district of Tyre: , Al-Baṣa, the source at Ma‘aṣuba, upper and lower Ḥanuta, the house of Bara (or Badia), the water spring, Hamun, and Mazy, that is the water tower [, cf. Y. Sussman, 45 (5736), 213–257]; and all that was acquired by Jews becomes forbidden.”: , Al-Baṣa, the source at Ma‘aṣuba, upper and lower Ḥanuta, Bet Badia, the water spring, Hamun. 19:28) is North of it at the source Ḥamul, so maybe ראש מיא and עמון are one and the same. In Galilean speech, ח, ע, א were undifferentiated., and Mazy.” Rebbi Mana said, what you enumerate was earlier. But now there [are other towns that were held by Israel and they are forbidden. “ 4:10 is: “Towns obligated for tithes in the district of Susita.” R. S. Lieberman points out that the obligation of tithes also extends to places freed from the obligation of the Sabbatical year. The text of the mosaic of Reḥov: העיירות אסורות בתחום סוסיתה. עיינוש ועין חרה ודמבר ועיון ויערוט וכפר יחריב ונוב .וחספייה וּכפר צמח. ורבי התיר כפר צמח. “These are the towns forbidden in district Susita: Al ‘Awaniš, Eyn Ḥara‘ (probably a pejorative name for a spring holy to a pagan deity), Dambar, Iyun (not the one in Lebanon) and Ya‘ruṭ, Kefar Yaḥrib, Nab, Ḥasfin, and Kefar Ẓemaḥ. Rebbi permitted Kefar Ẓemaḥ.” These are the towns forbidden in district] Susita: Al ‘Awaniš עושית., Eyn Tara‘, the heights of Barin, the spring Ya‘riṭ, Kefar Yaḥrib, Nab, Ḥasfin, and Kefar Ẓemaḥ. Rebbi permitted Kefar Ẓemaḥ.” Rebbi Immi asked: Are these not of the taxpayers? Rebbi Immi is of the opinion that taxpayers count as if they were conquered. “The following are the towns that were permitted in the district of Naveh 1:1), in the center of the Bašan plateau. The text is also in Tosephta 4:8. In the Tosephta: “Towns that were permitted in the district of Nave and became forbidden.” As Arab village, Nowa. The text from Reḥov reads: העיירות שהן ספק בתחום נווה ציר וצייר וגשמיי וזיזון ורנב .וחרבתה ואיגרי חותם וכרכרה דבר הרג. “The towns that are questionable (whether Jewish or Gentile) in the district of Naveh: Ṣaria, Ṭeriya, Jasim, Zizun, Regeb (?), the ruin and wall of , the palisades of .”: Ṣaria, Ṭeriya, Jasim, Zizun, the stone heaps of . 31.47. Identified by S. Klein as ‘Otman, E. of Zizun., Aldanba the ruin, the palisades of as Nabatean (maybe from زرج “shoot of vine”)..” A load of raisins came up to Tiberias. Gamliel the twin asked Rebbi Abba bar Kahana. He said to him: All of the Land of Israel does not produce a load of raisins. Does all of the Land of Israel not produce a load of raisins? But so he said to him: No single place in the land of Israel produces a load of raisins. A person brought a back-pack of פשל means: to let hang down (in Arabic: to fail, be unsuccessful.) of leeks to Rebbi Isaac bar Tevele. He asked Rebbi Joḥanan. He said to him, go and ask Ḥananiah ben Samuel who knows statements about this. He went and asked. He said, they did not show me a statement, but he told me an Amoraic tradition, since Rebbi Yasa said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi and Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon disagree: one says after its place of production, the other says, after its current stand. Rebbi Abbahu explained: Rebbi said, after its place of production and Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon, after its current stand. Rebbi Abbahu said that Rebbi said, after its place of production, and they taught him following Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon, after its current stand. This means for back packs, but for animal loads everybody agrees after its place of production. If its place of production and of current placement are free but he is going to transport it through forbidden territory, that forbidden territory is as if he did not traverse it. Rebbi Abba bar Cohen asked before Rebbi Yose: Did not Rebbi Ḥiyya say in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, between Rebbi and his colleague, practice follows Rebbi. But Rebbi Jonah said, even Rebbi with Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon? He said to him, what do you want from Rebbi Joḥanan! Rebbi Joḥanan follows his own opinion, for Rebbi Joḥanan said, they were very lenient regarding the Sabbatical, which is of their words10:32), it cannot be considered a Biblical commandment since it is intrinsically connected with the Jubilee year which presupposes that every family hold the grounds alotted to it in Joshua’s distribution. Since there can be no Jubilee, the Sabbatical stands only on popular acceptance.. Some want to say, the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan is added to that of Rebbi and they form a majority against Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who takes it upon himself to be trustworthy. gives tithes for what he eats, what he sells, and what he buys, and he is not a guest of an Rebbi Jehudah said, he who is a guest of an may be trustworthy. They said to him, for himself he is not trustworthy will serve him from which the heave of tithes was not taken, and by eating it he potentially commits a deadly sin, how can he be trusted by his customers that tithes were taken according to all rules?, how can he be trusted for others? HALAKHAH: “What he buys,” to eat it. But did we not state: “What he eats?” Hence, “what he buys” in order to sell it. But did we not state: “What he sells?” Hence, “what he buys” in order to sell it and “what he sells” from his own gathering. It was stated 2:1. As usual, the opinion of the anonymous author of the Mishnah is attributed to R. Meïr. The position taken in the Mishnah and here by R. Jehudah in the Tosephta is the collective opinion of the Sages. The sentence here is R. Jehudah’s (or the Sages’) reply that one never objected to any private person’s being the guest of an (What the observant person has to do in this case is described at the end of this Halakhah. The Yerushalmi accepts this relaxed standard for private persons but not for traders.): Rebbi Jehudah said, private persons never refrained from being guests of private persons of their acquaintance. Nevertheless, they used to put in order all their produce in their own houses. Rebbi Jonah said, is a person who takes it upon himself to observe the rules of ritual purity in his private life, away from the Sanctuary, and to avoid becoming impure if at all possible. With the disappearance of the last ways to cleanse oneself from the impurity induced by the dead (see the Notes to Mishnah 1:1), fellowship was slowly transformed into the fraternity of those who followed ritual law scrupulously. Since Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose are late Amoraïm, we have to assume that for them, fellowship and trustworthiness are practically identical; see the story about R. Simeon ben Laqish in the next Halakhah, Note 154. are not suspected either to eat or to serve to others who is seen eating at an ’s home or inviting an to eat with him loses his standing. There is no imputation that the home of the would not be kosher, but his food may be impure and eating it might break the vow of fellowship. That would not apply to fruits eaten dry, for example. But the food presented by the is by definition and it will be made clear that the vow of fellowship is a step above that of being trustworthy for tithes; hence, eating breaks trustworthiness and, , fellowship. If one gives of one’s food to an , it becomes impure by contact with the impure person which is a sure break of the vow of fellowship.. Rebbi Yose said, are suspected to eat but not to serve to others who is seen eating from a source considered as does not lose his standing since he might have put his food in order mentally as explained at the end of the Halakhah. In the next Halakhah, however, the statement of R. Yose is qualified to apply to trustworthy persons only, not to recognized .. The Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Yose: “They said to him, for himself he is not trustworthy, how can he be trusted for others?” The words of the rabbis support Rebbi Yose, for Rebbi Ḥanina, Rebbi Yasa, said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi Jehudah spoke only of the end, but at the start even Rebbi Jehudah will agree.’s, there is disagreement between R. Jehudah and the Sages. If you say that are not suspected either to eat or to serve to others, what is the difference between start and end? As we have stated 2:3, reproduced Babli 30b, but speaking of fellowship instead of trustworthiness. Again, the anonymous opinion here is R. Meïr’s in the Tosephta, and R. Jehudah’s here is that of the anonymous majority there. (Maimonides 10:9 follows the Babli and, hence, the opinion expressed here by R. Jehudah.): “He who takes it on himself to be trustworthy except for one thing cannot be accepted; he who is suspect in one thing is suspect in everything. Rebbi Jehudah said, he is only suspect in that thing alone.” It was stated: “He who is trustworthy for purity is trustworthy for tithes.” Rebbi Yannai ben Rebbi Ismaël stated it and explained his reason: That means, if one is a guest of his, but for the public he is not trustworthy until he accepts it publicly 2:14) speaks of “him who accepts before the fellowship.” However, the Babli ( 20b) requires “before three people” (who form a court of law.). Rebbi Ammi in the name of Rebbi Yannai: Even I am not trustworthy until we accept it in public 2:13) and the Babli ( 30b) exempt a member of a Rabbinic court since he would not have been accepted into the court had he not given a vow of fellowship.. Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Yasa, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Even a who sent to another , the recipient must tithe. Rebbi Zeïra asked before Rebbi Yasa, for example, I to Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac, and Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac to me? He answered him, what do you want from Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac, because all he eats, he eats from the market and immediately put in order.. “If 3:9, in slightly different language. The curse on the man whose wife is trustworthy while he is not is missing there. he is trustworthy but his wife is not, one buys from him but one cannot be his guest. But they said, he is like one who lives with a snake in the same basket that was not brought in order if he forgot to ask.. If his wife is trustworthy but he is not, one can be his guest but not buy from him. But they said, a curse should fall on him whose wife is trustworthy while he is not.” It was stated 3:6–7.: “A ” here is the trustworthy person, not necessarily a full member of the fellowship, but the language both here and in the Tosephta does not support this explanation. Maimonides, in Chapter 10 of , identifies trustworthy person and , but he writes for practical use and in his time the difference between the two had disappeared since nobody was able to eat in purity. However, as will be explained in the next Halakhah, one facet of fellowship, the washing of one’s hands before a meal, is still valid and this has to be added to the conditions of trustworthiness in any case. should not serve as waiter at the wedding feast of an or the dinner of an except when everything was in order and tithed under his control, even the wine ladle. But if may not serve at a dinner of untithed food, his presence is a guarantee of the kosher status of the entire meal. a acted as waiter at the wedding feast of an or the dinner of an this is evidence for tithes. If one saw him was not a waiter but a guest; his participation is not proof of anything since before the meal he could have made a mental stipulation to give the necessary tithes for what he ate from his own provisions at home when he returned; this is an acceptable way of tithing in emergencies (Mishnah 7:1). But he is not responsible for anybody else at the dinner, except for his dependents. lying on a couch it would not be evidence, since I say that he is lying on the couch after making the required mental stipulations. If his son is lying down next to him, he has to tithe for him; he does not have to tithe for another .”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who accepts upon himself to be a will not sell to the wet or dry is characterized by his disregard for ritual purity (except in Jerusalem during the three annual pilgrimages when the Temple was standing, when “all of Israel are ”), food sold to the will certainly become defiled. and will not buy wet from him can be assumed not to wash his hands before handling either drinks or wet food (such as olives); the food therefore is impure in the first degree and unfit for the . (Fluids that cause impurity are water, human body fluids, grape juice or wine, olive oil, and date honey.), is not guest of an and does not have him as a guest in his clothing have to be considered sources of original impurity and a can have an person as a guest only if he sends him first to the ritual bath to be purified and then clothes him in his own pure clothing. The stages of impurity are, in order, 1) “grandfather of impurity,” a dead person and the house in which there is a corpse, 2) original impurity, anything in contact with a corpse or in a house in which there is a corpse (with a few exceptions), and any other impurity described in the Torah, 3) impurity in the first degree, imparted by contact with original impurity or any impure fluid (because fluids might be in contact with impure human discharges, as above), 3) impurity in the second degree, imparted by contact with impurity of the first degree, also the status of any unwashed hands unless the person was careful that his hands should not touch anything absentmindedly, 4) impurity in the third degree, imparted by contact with impurity of the second degree, applicable to sacrifices and heave only, not to profane food (including profane food eaten under the rules of the heave), and 5) impurity in the fourth degree, imparted by contact with impurity of the third degree, applicable to sacrifices only, but not to heave or to profane food.. Rebbi Jehudah says, moreover he should not raise animals of the flock, should not overstep bounds by vows and laughter, should not defile himself with the dead 21:1). However, for the majority view, burying the dead is a most sacred duty because its reward is entirely in the hands of Heaven since the object of the duty can no longer give thanks., and be a regular in the house of study. They said to him, these are not included. HALAKHAH: “He will not buy wet from him,” hence dry is permitted since the are trustworthy as to preparation 11:38. Since the verb יתן is written defective, orthographically identical to the active form, it is concluded that even passive wetting must have an active ingredient, , that the wetting should be agreeable to the owner. Since the status of the produce depends on the owner and the rules were known to the , his word in this matter can be trusted.. And it was stated: “The is trustworthy to say, these fruits were never prepared. But he is not trustworthy to say that they were prepared but did not accept impurity by his person will make it most likely that it is impure..” By the first statement he invalidated the second’s, accepts all restrictions given in Mishnah 3. Why can he not accept that the will eat only dry produce not prepared for impurity?. Does this not disagree with Rebbi Jonah, since Rebbi Jonah said, are not suspect to eat or to serve to others? He should not go, defile his body and come to defile pure food must be presumed to be originally impure (. 15:6, 20), the will not be able to remain undefiled in that house; returning, he might defile all pure food in his own house.. It does not disagree even with Rebbi Yose, since Rebbi Yose said, are suspect to eat but not to serve to others. There one speaks about purity but here about tithes” of R. Yose is not really a but a person trustworthy for tithes.. “He who is trustworthy for purities is trustworthy for tithes.” It was stated 2:13, Babli 30b.: “Everybody who comes has to accept., even a learned ” by “trustworthy person.”; but a rabbi who has been sitting in rabbinical court does not have to accept because he did it at the moment he joined the court.” Rebbi La said, only if he really accepted it from the first hour on. Rebbi Yose asked, if it was from the first hour, what is the difference between a and an ? The position of Rebbi La parallels that of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, for Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish came to those of the house of Rebbi Yannai; the women saw him and removed themselves from before him. He said to them, I shall come to your house; I am an with respect to purities in the sense of the Mishnah even though he was number two in the rabbinical establishment of his time.. It was stated 2:14, a substantially different text in Babli 30b.: “He answers; his wife, servants, and minor children will accept before him. to the fellowship, his sons and household answer to him.” Some Tannaïm state: “He, his sons, and his household answer to the fellowship.” They do not disagree: the first, if they are dependent on their father; his wife, servants, and minor children will accept before him., the second, if they do not depend on their father. Rebbi Ḥalaphta ben Saul stated, adults answer to the fellowship, minors answer to him. It was stated 2:11 and Babli 30b: “One accepts for ‘wings’ and after that one accepts for purities.”: “One brings close for ‘wings’ 30b). The institution of washing one’s hands for profane food follows the discipline of the heave ( 2:1, fol. 64d). The washing required here is for any food since even dry food may become wet by saliva. The Babylonian version of the same discipline is to wash only for meals taken with bread ( 106a), but there fellowship was unknown. and after that one teaches about purity.” Rebbi Isaac ben Eleazar said, wings, smells 4:6). The Biblical original impurities produced by a person with gonorrhea refer not only to things he touches but also those on which he sits or which he carries or moves otherwise. A lesser impurity is imparted to things above him but which he does not move. These are called מדף, “a smell of impurity.” The list given is a syllabus of the different kinds of impurity the novice has to learn about., pushings, the person with gonorrhea, pushes or moves. These become impure even if never touched by the ., purity., tithes. “In earlier times, they said: One removes from fellowship a who became tax collector. They changed to say, one removes him from fellowship for the entire time he acts as tax collector. Once he left his collectorship, he is again treated as a 3:4, Babli 31a. Since taxes in antiquity were usually farmed out, the tax collector had to pay the anticipated taxes up front to the government and then try to recover them from the population. Since he incurred expenses for the collection, he was forced to collect more than what he had paid to the government. Any amount taken above his expenses is possibly theft, and certainly any amount taken above the official rate is robbery. The tax collector would not be in business if he did not make money. Hence, he probably is a thief and a robber and disqualified as member of a religious fellowship. However, in the absence of bidders the Roman government would force people to become tax collectors; the prior rule was therefore no longer enforceable or applicable.” Ḥiyya ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: One does not remove from fellowship a who went outside the Land 7:17); the person who leaves the Land automatically becomes impure. But this impurity is not from the Torah and is easily removed upon return; hence, leaving the Land on trips was not frowned upon (except for priests who had no compelling reason to go abroad.) Because of this impurity, the Israeli fellowship was impossible in Babylonia at all times.. Hence, a minor does not need to be brought close.",

All who sell wholesale in large quantities may sell .. The following sell wholesale in large quantities, for example grain buyers,,., “purchaser of grain, commissioner, purveyor”, from Greek σιτώνης “public buyer of grain,” wholesale grain merchant who worked with or for the government (E. G.). and sellers. HALAKHAH: There, heave of the tithe, and redeem the Second Tithe. The Mishnah here demands that the baker himself give and heave of the tithe., we have stated: “If one buys from the baker, a stove in the form of a truncated cone, the fire burning on the bottom. The bread dough is brought in from the top and slapped onto the walls to be baked into pittah; this motion of “slapping down” is expressed by the root נחת. The seller of baked goods, either the baker in a separate store adjacent to his baking establishment, or an independent dealer, is the פְּלָטֵר, from Greek πρατήρ. The baker will also bake other people’s dough for a fee; that case is not considered here., how does he tithe?” There you say, the buyer separates, and here you say, the baker separates. Rebbi Jonah said, Rebbi Eleazar and Rebbi Joḥanan disagree. One says, here if he works in purity, but he has hired a to knead the dough so that it should not become impure. If the baker handles dry flour or dry bread, nothing happens since profane dry food can be made impure only by original impurity. Therefore, the may take the heave of the tithe and ., there if he works in impurity following the rules.. The other says, here in retail, there in wholesale. We did not know who said what. Since Rebbi Joḥanan said, because of purity, it follows that Rebbi Eleazar is the one who said, here in retail, there in wholesale. It is difficult for Rebbi Joḥanan, if he works in purity, let him separate everything. It would be logical that he should not give anything because one does not deliver certain grain since we already have stated that the may not sell at all. Hence, in the majority of cases, the Second Tithe, together with the heave of the tithe, are already taken and there would remain only which is a duty upon bread dough only. to the . It is difficult for Rebbi Eleazar, if it is in retail, let him separate everything. Grocers are not permitted to sell ! The colleagues in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: It is Rebbi Meïr’s, since Rebbi Meïr said, they permitted to sell only to the commissioned grain merchant 56a.. Rebbi Yose objected, does not the Mishnah disagree? “The following sell wholesale in large quantities, commissioners and grain merchants.” Hence, there must be others! Rebbi Yose said, this is not what Rebbi Eleazar referred to, but the following, as we have stated 3:10, on the statement of the Mishnah, “The Sages did not obligate bakers to separate more than the heave of the tithe and ,” in slightly different wording.: “When is this statement operative, if he sells in his bakeshop or at the door of his bakeshop. But if he was selling in the bakery or in his bakeshop adjacent to the bakery, he must give all tithes on it.” The colleagues in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: It is Rebbi Meïr’s, since Rebbi Meïr said, they only permitted to the commissioned grain merchant to sell . Which (statement of) Rebbi Meïr? The one we have stated next: “Rebbi Meïr says, something which usually he measured wholesale and he measured retail, the retail is adjunct to the wholesale.” Rebbi Ḥiyya 3:10. stated: “Something which usually is measured wholesale and he measured it retail, the retail is adjunct to the wholesale..” And so the bakery is retail but the bakeshop is wholesale, there the wholesale is adjunct to the retail. The colleagues in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan. The colleagues say that it is a religious law to protect the innocent. Rebbi La says, it is a commercial law that the one who takes the larger margin is better able to absorb the costs.: Because of the children lest they should eat . Rebbi La in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, in retail, because the seller takes the large margin, the seller separates. In wholesale, because the buyer will take the large margin, the buyer separates. One statement supports one and another statement supports the other. A statement supports the colleagues: “Rebbi Neḥemiah said, that which is connected to a retail outlet is like retail, connected to a wholesale outlet it is wholesale.. The opposite statement is ascribed to R. Neḥemiah in the Tosephta, 3:11: “R. Neḥemiah says, anything sold in retail quantity is retail, in wholesale quantity it is wholesale,” supporting R. La.” A statement supports Rebbi La. It was stated: “Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa said, if he measured with a retail measure, he is obligated. Even if he did measure only one seah and a quarter = 1/24., he must tithe the quarter ” Rebbi Zeïra said, computation of gain is between them. If he measured for him the at the rate of quarter , since the seller takes the large margin, the seller separates. If he measures the quarter at the rate of , since the buyer will take the large margin, the buyer separates.",

Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Hoshaiah: It is a condition imposed by the Court that the fat be on the butcher and the sciatic tendon. 32:33). It must be cut out together with all the fat in which it is embedded. The butcher would naturally cut out only the minimum of fat in order to maximize his profit. on the buyer.

But the Sages say, one collects and chest, as described in 8:7, is collected and distributed without inquiring into the degree of religious observance of either donor or recipient. without asking and one distributes without asking, and he who wants to put in order should put in order. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Jonah said, our Mishnah speaks about poor , and about guests following Rebbi Joshua. It was stated 2:1: “Donkey drivers and private persons on the road from place to place may eat and they are free (from the obligation to tithe) until they reach their destination. Therefore, if their host gave them a separate room and they stayed there overnight, they have to tithe, otherwise they are exempt. It happened that Rebbi Joshua went to Rabban Joḥanan ben Zakkai at Beror Ḥayil, and some inhabitants of these localities brought them figs. They asked him, do we have to tithe? He said to them, if we stay overnight, we are obligated to tithe; otherwise, we are not obligated to tithe.” Because R. Joshua was such an important personality he and his students certainly were placed in a separate room; therefore, staying overnight alone creates the obligation of tithes. The obligation for heave and tithes only starts with the storage of the harvest. Since R. Joshua would not travel without a large group of students, keeping him overnight creates the duty to give heave and tithes. This is the explicit interpretation given in Yerushalmi 2:3.: “It happened that Rebbi Joshua went to Rabban Joḥanan ben Zakkai in Beror Ḥayil, and some local people brought them fruits. Rebbi Joshua said to them, if they stay overnight, we are obliged to tithe; otherwise, we are not obliged to tithe.” Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah speaks about poor. If you restrict to poor , you lock the door before poor poor, nobody will give to them.. How does Rebbi Yose hold about “the stranger? who will put their food in order. But why does R. Yose need to mention the traveller?” Following what was stated: “( 25:45) ‘Those who dwell among you,’ to include the stranger; Rebbi Eliezer said, that means the Gentile stranger. even though one may not satisfy a formal obligation with ” It was stated: “One has to declare.” In the opinion of Rebbi Jonah, it is understood so that he may bring it in order. that the Mishnah speaks about poor In the opinion of Rebbi Yose, the Mishnah speaks about poor; even if he informs him, what does he gain does not care, what has one gained by informing the recipient? The answer is that only a minority of the do not care, so why should he hurt the decent majority because of the actions of a few nonobservant persons?? Because of one who does not put in order? Rebbi Mana said, this means that he who gives in his home so that he may bring it in order. may not give from Sabbatical value because he would pay his debt with Sabbatical value. As it was stated does not care, what has one gained by informing the recipient? The answer is that only a minority of the do not care, so why should he hurt the decent majority because of the actions of a few nonobservant persons?: “Neither Sabbatical produce nor Second Tithe may be used to satisfy a loan or a debt. One does not use them for best men’s meals. One does not pay with them obligatory payments. One does not use them to pledge for charity in the synagogue. But one may use them for goodwill; then one has to notify.” There 7:3: “A worker who does not trust his employer should take one fig and say: This fig and the nine following shall be tithe on the 90 remaining that I will eat; this one will be heave of the tithe, the others will be redeemed by coins. (Mishnah 4) Then he saves one fig (assuming the employer gave him 100 for lunch.) Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, he should not save (but buy one with his own money and give it to the Cohen) because he reduces the work of the employer (by eating less than the allotted ration, he has less strength to work.) Rebbi Yose said, he should not save because this is a condition of the Court (that the employer must pay for the heave of the tithe.)” The argument here refers to what Rabban Gamliel did. Since he is mentioned by name, what he did is not accepted. The Sages conclude that the employer must give his farmhands fully tithed food. we have stated: “The worker who does not trust the employer.” There you say, the worker separates. But here you say that the employer separates. Rebbi Jonah said, there if he serves him counted portions, here if he lets him eat from the bowl. Rebbi Zeriqan, Simeon bar Abba, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: A medical doctor who is a , if he feeds a sick person who is an , shall put the food into his patient’s hand will eat but the is forbidden to serve others anything not fully tithed. but not into his mouth. That is, if it is , but if it is certain since it would clearly be forbidden (assuming that the sickness is not life-threatening and some other remedy is available.), it is forbidden even to put it in his hand. This means, if it is the patient’s property, but the doctor’s is forbidden, or even simply the person trustworthy for tithes, is not permitted to serve others anything that is not in order. “Descendant of Noah” means a Gentile, since all mankind is descended from Noah. The expression is used here to indicate that all of mankind are obligated by the Seven Commandments given to Noah (prohibition of murder, idolatry, incest and adultery, eating limbs taken from a living animal, blasphemy, and anarchism.) for a Jew; for a descendant of Noah57b, cf. Rashi on 9:4). it is permitted even if it is certain and the patient’s property, but the doctor’s is forbidden. But if it was a limb taken from a living animal it is forbidden even if it is the patient’s property, that he should not be caused to stumble. It is difficult for the House of Shammai, should he lose because he is worthy? He adds what he has to put in order. What is the reason of the House of Shammai? Even if you regulate him now, can you regulate him in the future will eat it untithed, and it will turn out that the administrator has led a fellow Jew into sin by giving him untithed food.? You cannot regulate him. What is the reason of the rabbis? If you investigate him he will reduce his charity giving. “ 3:16,17. The administrators of charity should not publicly announce on a holiday in the way they announce on weekdays, but they collect in private, carry it in their bosom, and distribute for each quarter separately. The administrators of the charity chest 8:7. In the Tosephta, this is the majority opinion, against R. Meïr who holds that one does not take from questionable sources during the Sabbatical year. should not be inquisitive in the courtyards of those who eat from the yield of the Sabbatical year. If one gave them bread it is permitted, because Jews are not suspected of giving anything other than money or eggs.” Rebbi Ḥananiah in the name of Rebbi Phineas: That means, at a place where people sow but do not eat. Since they are not suspected to eat, not to feed. “Cohanim who prepare dough in purity has to be taken from bread dough under the rules of the heave and be eaten in purity, and the by his touch would give primary impurity to the wet dough, as explained in Halakhah 2:3, it was customary to hire a Cohen to knead the dough in purity, take to eat it, and then hand the dough over to the to bake it. should not be inquisitive in the courtyards of those who eat from the yield of the Sabbatical year.” Some Tannaïm 3:17. stated: “They should be inquisitive.” Rebbi Phineas said, he who says that they should be inquisitive, because of their So the Tosephta requires the Cohen not only to take , but also to check whether the grain might be ; he who says that they should not be inquisitive, for he would save him from the simple sin and lead him to a deadly one. is a deadly sin, the Sabbatical year is a simple prohibition, the nonobservant would knead the dough himself and not give However, dough from which was not taken is , and its consumption is as bad a sin as consuming grain from which heave was not taken. Since the Cohen by his action leads the nonobservant into sin, the sin is the Cohen’s.. What does he do from dough he suspects to be from grain raised during the Sabbatical year, from which one cannot partake.? Rebbi Huna said, he brings a suspect Cohen in purity; hence, he has to send him to the (and, as R. Mana points out, watch him in purity until sundown.) See Mishnah 1:1., lets him immerse himself, and serves it to him. But then does he not deliver pure foods to an .”) In this case, the observant Cohen would lead the nonobservant into sin.? Rebbi Mana said, he brings a suspect Cohen, lets him immerse himself, watches him until sundown and then serves it to him. But then does he not support the sinners? Rebbi Simeon from Carsan in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: He keeps it until the day before Passover and then burns it and must be eaten; they may be burned only if they are either impure or on Passover eve if they contain leavened material. Since it is forbidden to make holy things impure intentionally, the Cohen has to keep in purity until he is forced to burn it on Passover eve..",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who wants to cut off greens of vegetables in order to lighten his load should not throw them away before he tithed. He who buys vegetables on the market and then decides to return them should not return them before he tithed, because nothing is missing but counting. If he stopped to buy but saw another, better, load, he may change his mind because he did not take it up. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Eleazar said, it is Rebbi Meïr’s, since Rebbi Meïr said, they permitted to sell only to the commissioned grain wholesaler. Rebbi Joḥanan said, it is according to everybody; there is a difference because the one who takes it up takes it up in retail quantity and the one who abandons does not abandon wholesale. But does this not disagree with Rebbi Meïr6:1 (Babli 43a–44a)., since Rebbi Meïr is the one who says that as soon as a person abandons anything of his property, it is legally abandoned as soon as it leaves his power. There is a difference because the one who takes it up takes it up in retail quantity and the one who abandons does not abandon wholesale. It does not even disagree with Rebbi Yose, for Rebbi Yose says that nothing may leave the power of its owners except if it is taken up; otherwise it was not legally abandoned. There is a difference here, because the one who abandons abandons wholesale, and the one who takes it up, takes up only retail quantities. Ḥizqiah said, nothing is missing for the owners but the credit by counting. How does he do it? He takes from the uppermost layer and puts it in order. Is that not forbidden because of robbery? Like that of Rebbi Simeon bar Cahana who was supporting Rebbi Eliezer. They passed by a vineyard. He said to him, bring me a sliver (one sixth or one eighth of a copper ) is not considered robbing. as a toothpick. He changed his mind and told him, do not bring me anything; if everybody would do that, the fence of this man would be gone. Rebbi Ḥaggai was supporting Rebbi Zeïra. A person passed by who was carrying a load of chips. He said to him, bring me a chip as a toothpick. He changed his mind and told him, do not bring me anything; if everybody would do that, the load of this man would be gone. Is not Rebbi Zeïra particularly pious? No, he told us that we should observe the words of our Creator. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: When he took one stalk, nothing was missing but counting them. How does he do it? He pays for one of them without tithing and the seller can sell it as such. and puts it in order. But does it not turn out that he creates an obstacle for those who come after him or One may not give heave from produce already tithed and if the next buyer would use from the already tithed produce for heave of the tithe, that act would be void and he would in fact be eating ? Let him make a separate heap. But why can he not fix them in his own produce? Did we not state 4:8: “One may give the heave of the tithe for produce of an , even if this creates an obstacle for those who will come later,” meaning later buyers from the who is the seller; the buyers might treat the produce that was put in order as and use it for illegitimate tithing of other produce.: “A person may fix his tithes for someone else, even if he creates an obstacle for those who come after him.” Rebbi Ḥinena said, they made that ordinance for the buyer who has no choice but to buy from an seller, in the absence of a on the market. Since the is prohibited from buying produce that is not in order, he is forced to stipulate that he will put the seller’s produce in order before concluding the deal. He naturally will tell the seller that his produce will be put in order, but he has absolutely no guarantee that the seller will transmit this information to the other buyers. However, since everything will be fine if the seller really warns the next buyers not to use his produce for tithing, no blame can be attached to the who uses his own to put the s produce in order. But this is permitted only to a bona fide buyer, not to one who changes his mind alter already acquiring the produce. but not for him who returns [produce]. So says the Mishnah but saw another, better batch, he may change his mind because he did not take it up.” Since “to buy” has a connotation of “taking it,” the word is changed to “selecting.”: “If he stood selecting.” So far, of the same kind. Also, from a different kind.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who finds produce on the road and takes it to eat it, but then changed his mind to store it, should not store it until he tithed it. If from the start he took it up only so that it should not be spoiled, he is free. Anything a person is not permitted to sell as , he may not send to a friend as Rebbi Yose permits certain produce on condition that he inform him. HALAKHAH: It was stated: “One does not pass by foodstuffs. 64b) to R. Joḥanan in the name of R. Simeon bar Ioḥai.” Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: That means, in earlier times. But now it is permitted because of sorcery. There 3:3., we have stated: “He who turns over cow dung in the public domain and a third party was hurt, is liable for damages.” It was also stated 2:8: “He who turns over cow dung in the public domain in order to acquire it, and another person was hurt by it, he is liable, and it is forbidden because of robbery. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, it is not robbery to impair the public domain.” The person who acquired the dung is liable but, since he acquired it, one is forbidden to take it from him, but he may take it from the owner of the cattle since it was in the public domain and an obstacle to travelers.: “It is forbidden because of robbery.” Cahana p. 247. said, only if he turned it over in order to acquire it. But if he did not turn it over in order to acquire it, about that one does not speak. But as regards damages, there is no difference whether he turned it over in order to acquire it or he did not turn it over in order to acquire it; if a third party was hurt, he is liable for damages 3:3, fol. 3c, and of R. Eleazar in Babli 29b.. And here, you say so? Rebbi Abun said, there it is written ( 21:34): “The one responsible for the pit shall pay,” the one responsible for the damage shall pay. But here ( 14:22): “You shall give tithes,” you give tithes from your property but not from other people’s property. “Anything a person is not permitted to sell as , he may not send to a friend as ” Retail quantities which one is not permitted to sell as , one may not send to a friend as Wholesale quantities which one is permitted to sell as , one may send to a friend as “Rebbi Yose permits certain produce,” be it retail or wholesale quantities, but he forbids retail quantities that are . Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: They permitted in wholesale quantity because of its being fenced in, no will refrain from giving the appropriate tithes.. This is a 11:4) takes everything together as one statement. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel in Tosephta 2:12 quotes Rebbi Yose that the kinds mentioned in the Mishnah fall under the monetary limitations spelled out in Halakhah 2:5. Maimonides seems to think that the final statement in this paragraph (that R. Yose himself did not act according to his own opinion but deferred to that of his colleagues), applies to the entire Tannaitic statement here. In the opinion of R. Abraham ben David, the first sentence is a quote from the Mishnah, but the following text is from some Tosephta collection. Hence, he thinks that practice should follow R. Yose in 2:5, but not in 3:3.: “Rebbi Yose says, baskets of figs, baskets of grapes, and boxes of vegetables, as long as they are sold , are free. 2:14: “Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, it happened that the great Rebbi Yose sent me an () from Sepphoris and said to me: this came into my hand from Caesarea. And I understood from this three things: That it was certain, could become impure, and he did not have another one, because if he had, he would have tithed from one on the other.” A discussion of this text appears in Tosaphot 58b–59a. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, the great Rebbi Yose sent me an and said to me: this came into my hand from Caesarea came from Caesarea maritima.. I understood from this three things: That it was certain, could become impure, and he did not have another one. That it was certain, because the fruits of Caesarea are certain. That it could become impure, because they sprinkle water on it. That he did not have another one, because if he had, he would have tithed from one on the other.” Why could he not have tithed from itself on itself? Because he was mindful of the saying of Bar Kappara, for Bar Kappara said that people do not send things that are defective to their friends. But is that not our Mishnah? “Rebbi Yose permits certain produce on condition that he inform him.” This tells you that, even though he disagreed with the rabbis, he did not act according to his own opinion. Rebbi Zeïra asked before Rebbi Yasa: It this not from the fruits that are exempt at Caesarea is not on the list given in Halakhah 2:1 of fruits at Caesarea. Hence, it is not excluded that the came from the Land of Israel near Caesarea Philippi (Banias),? He said to him, did not Rebbi permit fruits at Caesarea? But Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel preceded Rebbi!",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Wheat brought to be milled 61b. by a Samaritan or by an remains in its prior state for tithes or and Sabbatical year. By a Gentile, it is . Produce deposited with a Samaritan or with an remains in its prior state for tithes and Sabbatical year; with a Gentile, it is like his produce. Rebbi Simeon says, it is 67b) R. Simeon holds that the rabbis decreed for Gentile produce so that Jewish landowners should not have an incentive to hand their land over to Gentile sharecroppers.]. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan 1:10, fol. 25d.: If his box was exchanged at the miller’s, if it was established that an gave to be milled there that day, he has to worry’s and therefore ; then he has to tithe a second time.; otherwise, he does not have to worry. Should he not worry? What is the difference between this and the Saracens? Was it not stated: “If a group of Saracens one day provisioned themselves from forbidden supplies, then that day becomes a proof for all days even though the greater part of it may be Gentile and exempt. Hence, if we see that an uses that mill one day, why should we not assume that an uses it every day?.” It is impossible for Saracens not to supply themselves. But here it was not established that the was milling there that day cannot be trusted, which is nothing new and does not need proof. But the mill does not become an ’ mill by that.. Rebbi Taypha the Red in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: Samaritans can be trusted with deposits. Is that not the Mishnah: “With a Samaritan”? Our Mishnah before they became suspect, he comes to tell us even after they became suspect 5:3, fol. 44d (quoted in Babli 6a) that in the times of Rebbis Ammi, Assi, and Abbahu, Samaritans were found to use Gentile wine (or to adopt Gentile behavior), and from that moment on Samaritans were considered as Gentiles. However it seems from the Yerushalmi that up to the end of the Talmudic period in Galilee, the separation of Jews and Samaritans was not universally accepted. (One also may assume that parts of Jewish Sadducee communities changed to a Samaritan affiliation after the destruction of the Temple.). How is it, should he be trusted to say, I took it and replaced it by other deposits that were put in order? If you believe him in that he took it, you should believe him in what he gave. If you do not believe that he took, do not believe that he gave 4:22), this argument is given in reference to deposits with an . You believe a Samaritan that he gave4:24) one reads: “If he says, I took it and replaced it with some that was put in order, one does not worry either about tithes or about the Sabbatical.” and you do not believe that he took. Rebbi Jonah asked: What are we talking about? If he says, they are my own, even an should not be trusted. If he says, X took tithes for me, even the Samaritan should be believed. Rebbi Abba said, explain it according to him who says that a Samaritan is like a Gentile. As they disagreed: A Samaritan is like a Gentile, the words of Rebbi. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, a Samaritan is like a Jew in every respect. Here you say, “by a Gentile miller, they are ,” there you say, “with a Gentile, they are like his produce.” In the first case, a box among boxes, there, produce among his produce. Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Zeïra: Does it mean, really like his produce? Freeing what would be at another place? He said to him, for all that is in it, i. e., if the produce was in order it does not become even at the Gentile’s, but it cannot lose its status of either or . Rebbi Ḥanina was uselessly opposing Rebbi Aḥa. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abin in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: Rebbi Simeon said, only for one box. If he handed over two boxes, one of them is and one is certain if they are still in existence and one is certain.; but if the first one was consumed, the second one is . If a hundred people took from him 100 at one time, each one puts his produce in order as If they gave it all to one person, it should be considered as certain. If one person took many together, the first one is , the rest certain. If he then gave the rest to a hundred people, it should be considered as certain. Did we not state in the name of Rebbi Simeon in the name of Rebbi Ṭarphon: “They made the produce of this Jew like the produce of that Samaritan 4:25): “Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel and Rebbi Simeon: The Jew’s produce made this Gentile’s produce ” The word “Samaritan” in the Yerushalmi seems to be a scribal error. The question is about the interpretation of the Tosephta (or an equivalent ), and the answer is that the Tosephta is exactly parallel to the Mishnah and gives the reason for the Mishnah, but it does not extend R. Simeon’s disagreement with the Tanna of the Mishnah., ” That again is the same; Rebbi Simeon said, only for one box. “ 1:12–14 {commentary in braces}: “12. A storage facility into which Jews and Gentiles contribute; if the majority are Gentile it is certain, if the majority are Jewish, it is ; these are the words of R. Meïr {who holds that produce of the Holy Land is subject to heave and tithes even if grown by a Gentile.} But the Sages say, it is even if all the contributors are Gentile except one Jew {since produce of the Holy Land is not subject to heave and tithes if grown by a Gentile.} 13. Rebbi Yose said, when are these words said, for a private storage facility, but at a government storage facility {for storing taxes paid in kind} one follows the majority. They said to him, you taught us about the storage facility of Jabneh, which is inside the walls, that it is , and most of the contributors are Samaritans {who are subject to tithes but certainly will not tithe what they personally do not use}; but a storage facility outside the Land, e. g., that of Ragab {a place in Jordan} is obligated only according to percentages {of the supply coming from the Land.} 13. Rebbi Joshua ben Qabusai said, all my life I read this verse ( 19:19): ‘ pure shall sprinkle on impure,’ and I did not understand it until the storage at Jabneh; I learned from the storage facility at Jabneh that one pure person sprinkles on many impure persons.” Rebbi Joshua ben Qabusai 75b) but thinks one cannot intermarry with them because of their deviating interpretation of some incest prohibitions. said, all my life I read this verse (19:19): ‘ pure shall sprinkle on impure,’ that one pure person sprinkles on one impure person, until I learned it from the storage facility at Jabneh. This means that one pure person sprinkles on many impure persons. in the presence of many Samaritans. {In the Babli, 61b, the verse is taken to mean that only a person who may become impure by Biblical standards, i. e., a Jew, can sprinkle the water with the ashes of the red heifer to cleanse another Jew from the impurity of the dead. In ,129, R. Aqiba infers that the water was purifying only if a pure person sprinkles on an impure one but sprinkling on a pure person makes him impure. This is accepted by the Yerushalmi, 1:2 (fol. 38d); a Babli source ( 14a) quotes and follows a dissenting opinion of the Sages. , 19, notes that only a pure person becomes impure; a person impure but not through a corpse is not influenced by being sprinkled. Since in general follows R. Ismael, this supports the position of the Yerushalmi that R. Aqiba’s statement is accepted by everybody.}” “But the Sages say, it is even if all the contributors are Gentile except one Jew”. But we have stated: “With a Gentile, they are like his produce as in a storage facility?.” Rebbi Eleazar said, the Sages who follow the line of Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Joḥanan said, these are really the Sages. They asked him, what is the reason? He told them, if you get whitehaired, I might tell you. What would he have told them? That they accepted tithes voluntarily, Northvale NJ 1995, p. 280–281. Since the obligation is similar in nature to a rabbinic ordinance, it follows the rules of leniency valid for such ordinances.. Samuel bar Abba asked: It is understandable that he did not tell them about pure food, because of a fence for pure food. He did not tell them about tithes, as a fence for tithes. He did not tell them about sacrifices; if he had told them, what would he have told them? For tithes, following him who says that they accepted tithes voluntarily. Rebbi Jeremiah, Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi Simeon agrees that one must separate tithes as a matter of practice. Hence, Rebbi Simeon says that one separates, and the rabbis say that one saparates certainly must be tithed. The only inference to be drawn is from “agrees”, which would imply that the Sages also require tithing and that the declaration of “his own produce” can only be used in a negative, not in a positive sense. Hence, the Sages also require tithing. .What is the difference between them? Rebbi Simeon says, he separates and takes money from the tribe. The rabbis say that he separates and does not take money from the tribe. But is it not even like heave from outside the Land, does he not take money from the tribe? Maybe it was said on the principle of for produce of the Gentile? Since we have stated: Rebbi Jehudah and Rebbi Simeon say, a Gentile may acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to free it from the tithes imposed on it Chapter 4, Notes 129–131.. Rebbi Jeremiah, Rebbi Ḥiyya. in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi Simeon agrees that nevertheless he must separate tithes as a matter of practice.",

This Mishnah (and the next) are quoted in Babli 6a–b; there, the interpretation is that the innkeeper will try to please her guests and maybe substitute fresher produce or spices for him, whereas R. Yose takes a dim view of innkeepers and thinks that if she takes anything it is in order to steal.. Rebbi Yose said, we are not responsible for the dishonest, it is her own fault if she commits a deadly sin.; he tithes only what he receives from her. HALAKHAH: Both Rebbi Yose and Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel 5:1 states that a vineyard in the fourth year (whose fruits may not be eaten without redemption) is signalized by lumps of earth placed around it, and any orchard in the first three years after planting (whose fruits are forbidden for any use) by lumps of clay. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel notes that this has to be done only in the Sabbatical year, when all growth is ownerless, but that in all other years, when taking from enclosed orchards and vineyards is theft, no signalizing is required since we are not responsible for the salvation of thieves. said the same thing. Just as Rebbi Yose said, we are not responsible for the dishonest, so Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, we are not responsible for the dishonest. It is reasonable that Rebbi Yose will agree with Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, but Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel will not agree with Rebbi Yose. Rebbi Yose will agree with Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel that we are not responsible for the dishonest. But Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel will not agree with Rebbi Yose, because it is not fitting for a that anything not in order should leave his house 32a, 9a) in the name of R. Ḥanina (there called R.

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who married the daughter of an who gives to his mother-in-law tithes what he gives to her and what he receives from her because she is suspect to switch spoiled food. Rebbi Jehudah says, she wants to put her daughter in a good light and is ashamed before her son-in-law. Rebbi Jehudah agrees that if he gives to his mother-in-law in the Sabbatical year she is not suspect of switching to feed her daughter from Sabbatical produce. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Joḥanan said, the first sentence also gives the opinion of Rebbi Jehudah. But the rabbis say, one who gives to his mother-in-law is like one who gives to his neighbor. As we have stated 4:31, speaking of a who gives something to bake or cook to his neighbor. The Tosephta is a little more explicit, reading in the last sentence: “he worries about the sour dough and spices for the Sabbatical year and tithes,” not the foods he gave her.: “He who gives bread to his neighbor to bake for him, or a dish to cook for him, has to worry neither about the Sabbatical year nor about tithes. That is, if he also gave her sour dough or spices. But if he did not give sour dough and spices, he worries about the Sabbatical year and about tithes.” Does it mean his mother-in-law after the first Chapter 6, Note 46. or the second marriage ceremony? Let us hear from the following: “Rebbi Jehudah agrees that if he gives to his mother-in-law in the Sabbatical year she is not suspect of switching to feed her daughter from Sabbatical produce.” Is there a difference between first and second marriage ceremony? Here also, there is no difference between first and second marriage ceremony.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who buys produce from a person who is not trustworthy for tithes and forgot to tithe them may ask the seller on the Sabbath and eats on the seller’s information. At nightfall, when Sabbath ends, he may not eat until he tithed. If he did not find the seller, but another person who is not trustworthy for tithes told him that it is tithed, he may eat on that information. At nightfall when Sabbath ends, he may not eat until he tithed. Heave of the tithe that returned to its origin, in general the produce cannot be fixed since heave cannot be used to take heave for other produce. (If the heave which falls into profane food is less than .99%, something can be done.) All rules are given in 5. If heave of the tithe falls into the produce from which it was taken, there results a major complication and a potential great monetary loss since Cohanim will pay little for produce containing heave. If the heave should be impure, the entire batch would be a total loss since, in the case which is described in the Mishnah, the heave (1%) falls into the remainder (99%) and, therefore, is turning everything into ‘. In that case, and since most are supposed to tithe, if the untrustworthy seller asserts that heave was taken, no heave fell into the produce and all is permitted for profane use.. Rebbi Simeon from Shezur said, even on weekdays he asks the seller and eats on his information. HALAKHAH: The colleagues in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: They permitted it because of the glory of the Sabbath. If it is because of the glory of the Sabbath, why does he have to ask him if those rules should be followed at all.? By way of finding a cause. Rebbi Bibi in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: The fear of the Sabbath is on him, who will not desecrate the Sabbath. and he will speak the truth. If the fear of the Sabbath is on him, why did we state that at nightfall, when the Sabbath ends, he may not eat until he tithed? Because of one who does not fear the Sabbath. It was stated 5:1.: “If he asks him on weekdays, he may not eat on the Sabbath.” According to him who says that the fear of the Sabbath is on him, this is fine. According to him who says that it is because of the glory of the Sabbath; when he asks him on weekdays, should he not eat on the Sabbath? It was stated only for someone acting in error, not intentionally, as we have stated: If he forgot to tithe, if he had made no previous stipulation, where heave can be given only from what clearly is in the tither’s possession, this kind of stipulation is permitted for It is even permitted for one person to make the stipulation for a whole group of people eating together.. But with a stipulation, one eats even on the stipulation by a friend. May one eat on the question of another person? How is that understood? If two persons bought at the same time from him, if one of them asked him, the other may not eat until he tithed or also asked; I say he tithed one batch, but not the other. If one person bought from him two fig cakes and asked him about one of them, he may not eat from the second cake until he tithed or asked him; I say that he tithed one but not the other. At nightfall when Sabbath ends, he tithes from one on the other. According to him who says that it is because of the glory of the Sabbath, this is fine. According to him who says that the fear of the Sabbath is on him, why should he be able to tithe from one on the other? So far, if he has nothing of the same kind. Even if he has of the same kind, that is a matter of preference. A holiday next to the Sabbath, be it before the Sabbath or after the Sabbath, and likewise the two holidays of the diaspora, according to him who says they are one sanctity, he may eat; according to him who says that they are two sanctities, he may not eat 3, fol. 21b, and 1:1, fol. 60a, Babli 38a–39a, in connection with as explained in , Chapter Eight, Note 56. The question is now whether one may make one for the Sabbath and another one for another direction for the Sunday following which is a holiday. If the sanctities fit together smoothly, this is not possible. If there is a clean break, it is possible.. Even according to him who says that they are two sanctities, he may eat as long as there was no possibility to tithe between them, it certainly is not possible to tithe. Hence, there is no legal “nightfall after the Sabbath” as envisaged by the Mishnah.. It was stated 5:1.: “If he asks him on the holiday, he eats on the Sabbath; if he asks him on the Sabbath, he eats on the holiday.” Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Zeïra, explain it regarding produce he had intended to use on Sabbath eve. But produce he had not intended on Sabbath eve (to use during the Sabbath) is not included. Rebbi Mana said, the words of the rabbis support Rebbi Jonah, my father, since we have stated there declares that under the penalties of breaking a vow he will have no relations with the other person, a , unless that other person comes to his house to eat with him on the Sabbath but the does not trust the with the tithes, the may eat at ’s the place the first Sabbath even though he is not trustworthy for tithes, on condition that he tell him that all is tithed. On the second Sabbath, even though he makes a vow to abstain from all benefit from him, he shall not eat until he tithed. {Since tithing must be done before the Sabbath, it seems that the question also must be asked before the Sabbath.} This somewhat contrasts with Mishnah 7:1: “One who is invited by a person whom he does not trust with tithes says on Friday afternoon: Anything that I shall in the future separate for what I am going to eat shall be First and Second Tithes. The First Tithe shall become the heave of the tithe and the Second Tithe shall be redeemed with coins.” Hence, it is possible to tithe mentally under the right circumstances. In the case of a holiday following a Sabbath, if one is mentally prepared, one may transfer the permission of Sabbath to the holiday.: “He who takes a vow regarding his friend that he will eat at his place but he does not trust him with the tithes.” Rebbi Yannai ben Rebbi Ismaël in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: On the Sabbath of the preliminary marriage, Chapter 6, Note 46). A big meal was given for the community on the Sabbath preceding קידושין and not to appear would have been an insult to the families of the young couple. The invited guest could retroactively tithe what he ate, according to Mishnah 7:1. If he forgot, he could rely on the assertion of the untrustworthy. In medieval Germany, the festivity was called (from Italian ). they permitted because of hatred. Is the Sabbath of the preliminary marriage not comparable to produce that on Sabbath eve he intended to use (later on the Sabbath)? Nevertheless, he only said “because of hatred.” If he invited him the first Sabbath but he did not come, the second time he should not eat unless he tithes or asks him. Did he not already ask him? Rebbi Jonah said, there he asked for himself. But here a third party asked about it. Rebbi Jonah asked: May he ask him in a roundabout way? Rebbi Jonah asks in this way. Rebbi Jonah bought wheat from Bar Ḥaqulah. He went to him and said, not that I suspect you, but since I bought wheat from you and I saw a multitude, p. 612). with you, I said maybe you forgot to put them in order. Were they put in order? He complained strongly about him and said: Why do you suspect me? It was stated: “Heave of the tithe from that returned to its origin makes ‘‘ (a word of unclear etymology, 22:28) describes profane produce mixed with heave, which is unfit for human consumption if heave and food are impure, and is food only for Cohanim and their families if both the heave and the food are pure. It can be put in order only if the amount of heave in the total is less than 1 in 101. Since heave from is genuinely holy only in a minority of cases, that heave does not necessarily create ‘. (Maimonides 12:4 and R. Abraham ben David ad .), not to its origin does not make ‘. Rebbi Simeon from Shezur said, both at its origin and not at its origin it does not make ‘.” Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Zeïra: For one who says, it makes ‘, it makes ‘; for one who says, it does not make ‘, it does not make ‘; this is reasonable cannot create ‘. I also could understand the position that, once the name of heave was attached to any produce, it must be treated like heave in all respects.. But if one says, in its origin it makes ‘, not in its origin it does not make ‘; what is the difference between in its origin and not in its origin? Rebbi Ḥaggai came up. They said, this one will say, “by Moses, I shall explain the reason.” He said, by Moses, I shall explain the reason: He who says, it makes ‘, because it permits the rest to be eaten may not be eaten by rabbinic ordinance, it should in this respect be treated like heave taken according to Biblical precept.. He who says, it does not make ‘, because it does not permit the rest to be eaten. Rebbi La taught according to that of Rebbi Ḥaggai.. Rebbi Zeïra said: A case came before Rebbi Ḥanina and he taught according to Rebbi Simeon from Shezur. Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: Practice does not follow Rebbi Simeon from Shezur 75b, both R. Ḥanina and R. Jonathan endorse the ruling of R. Simeon from Shezur as valid practice.. “In addition, Rebbi Simeon from Shezur said: If he separated the heave of the tithe and it was burned, he asks the seller and eats on his information 5:2: “Heave of the tithe which returned to its origin. Rebbi Simeon from Shezur said, even on weekdays he asks the seller and eats on his information. In addition, Rebbi Simeon from Shezur said: If he separated heave and tithes and the produce was stolen, he asks the seller and eats what he separated on his information, because just as the fear of the Sabbath is on the , so the fear of ‘ is on him.” The different here has to be interpreted in the same way, viz., that the main body of produce was burnt and he was left only with heave and tithes. Because of the monetary loss, he was permitted to treat heave and tithes as profane food on the untrustworthy seller’s word..” Did Rebbi Zeïra not say that a similar case came before Rebbi Ḥanina and he taught according to Rebbi Simeon from Shezur? Rebbi Avin said, this question does not compare to the first question. There it was, not that I suspect you, but since I bought wheat from you yesterday and I saw a multitude with you, I said maybe you forgot to put them in order. Were they put in order? But here, because I suspected you, I put them in order but they went up in fire. Were they put in order? Rebbi Samuel, the son of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said that Bar Kappara stated: The fear of ‘ is on him and he will tell the truth‘ are, even if he himself is only aware that he must separate the first heave, he will not be a party to such a grave sin. It follows that the Tosephta before us is in the tradition of Bar Kappara, and that it is part of the original statement of R. Simeon from Shezur..",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: Rebbi Eliezer says, nobody has to give a name to the tithe of the poor from is only by doubt, no poor man can go to court and sue to collect the tithe. The tithe of the poor is only a civil obligation and no sanctity is attached to it. R. Eliezer says that in years 3 and 6 the tithe is nonexistent for but the Sages, according to Maimonides in his Mishnah Commentary, hold that in order to protect the separation and redemption of Second Tithe in other years, one has at least to indicate that the tithe of the poor, if given, would have to be at a fixed part of the stored produce (e. g., at the Northern or Southern end.). But the Sages say, he has to give a name but does not have to separate. He who gave a name to his heave of the tithe of , or to the certain tithe of the poor, should not separate them on the Sabbath. But if a Cohen or a poor person were used to eat from his food at his table, they may come and eat it or and the owner may eat simultaneously with his guests as long as the guests know that they are eating heave or tithe. on condition that he inform them. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Abba bar Huna on 1:3), this tradition is ascribed to Rav Bibi and Rav Huna. The title is incorrect; it should be רב but because of the elided א in the name Abba the text cannot be emended. in the name of Rav: He who eats his produce without having separated the tithe of the poor commits a deadly sin 16b, Rav is quoted as saying that such a person is whipped, implying that it is not a deadly sin.. What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? Because he in the years of the tithe of the poor will not contain that tithe. Such an argument were impossible if we would read “Second Tithe” in the statement attributed to Rav. knows that it would be a deadly sin, he will separate it. What is the reason of the rabbis? He only has to give a name but does not have to separate it on 1:3), this tradition is ascribed to Rav Bibi and Rav Huna. The title is incorrect; it should be רב but because of the elided א in the name Abba the text cannot be emended.. It was stated 3:6: “If somebody was seen separating the Second Tithe, he is trustworthy for the First Tithe, the words of R. Eliezer. But the Sages say, if he is trustworthy for the First, he is trustworthy for the Second; he who is trustworthy for the Second is not trustworthy for the First. If he separated heave, First and Second Tithes, and ate from it, he is trustworthy for that kind of food but not for any other kind, the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, even for that kind he is not trustworthy {unless he passes the formal tests of trustworthiness}; you cannot trust him for he might put in order for himself but leads others astray {by eating kosher produce but selling }” The text here makes little sense. It seems that the first two words of the next clause are dittography. The implication is that the formal induction into , described in Chapter 2, does solve all problems in theory but not in practice since many people will be reluctant to wear a badge that proclaims their superiority over fellow Jews. Hence, we need some guidelines to recognize people who follow the rules without ostentation.: He is trustworthy if they saw him separate the Second Tithe. It was stated: For the Second, he is trustworthy for the First, the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, if he trustworthy for the First, he is trustworthy for the Second. He who is trustworthy for the Second is not trustworthy for the First. What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? Is it because he is not suspected of advancing the tithe, or because if he separated the Second it is a standing presumption that he separated the First? But did we not state: “Rebbi Eliezer says, nobody has to give a name to the tithe of the poor from ” Hence, for the Second it is needed. Since he has to separate the Second, on which the owner earns no goodwill he certainly will separate the First, on which he earns goodwill! “If somebody brought out Second Tithe from his house to somebody and said: ‘It is redeemed,’ he is trustworthy; ‘redeem for me and yourself,’ 12:5) reads פדוי לי ופדוי לכם “it is redeemed for me and is redeemed for you,” interpreted to mean “it is redeemed following my standards and I hope that is good enough for you.” He declares himself not to follow generally accepted standards and makes himself untrustworthy. The classical commentators follow this reading. he is not trustworthy.” The is Rebbi Eliezer’s, since Rebbi Eliezer said, he who is trustworthy for the Second is trustworthy for the First. Rebbi Yose said, everybody agrees, they made it like additions to First Fruits farmer whether the additional fruits are tithed, he is by law required to believe what the farmer tells him (Maimonides 13:14).. Just as additions to First Fruits are eaten in purity and are free from , so this is eaten as Second Tithe and is free from the First. Rebbi Ḥananiah confirmed in the name of Rebbi Issi: it is Rebbi Eliezer’s Hence, the is R. Eliezer’s and the Sages make trustworthiness dependent exclusively on the rules given in Chapter 2.. This is the Mishnah: He should not hand them over on the Sabbath, since we have stated there: “The House of Shammai say that one does not bring and 18:3). to the Cohen on a holiday, whether they were separated the day before or on the day itself, but the House of Hillel do permit this.” The first statement implies the second, the second implies the first. The first statement implies the second; there is no difference between holiday and Sabbath, and to slaughter, hence to create new gifts for the Cohen. But property may not be transferred at all according to the House of Shammai, and according to the House of Hillel only in a roundabout way, when the Cohen eats his part at the table of the giver.. The second implies the first; that is, if they are used to. But if they are not used to, no person comes to eat his piece of bread at another’s house. It was stated 7:8:“There are seven kinds of thieves and the worst of them is the thief of opinons: He who importunes another person to be his guest while he knows that the other will not accept, he who offers many gifts while he knows that the other will not accept, he who opens a new barrel for a guest when from its contents he will sell to a grocer, etc.” In these cases, the person invited, offered gifts, or wine from a brand new barrel, thinks that the other party is ready to go to real expense on his behalf when in reality the pretending giver knows that it will cost him nothing. This paragraph is added because in the Mishnah, Cohen and poor have to be informed that they are eating heave and tithe which is forbidden to their host.: “One should not importune anybody to be his guest if he knows that the other person will not accept. He should not offer many gifts of closeness if he knows that the other person will not accept.” What are gifts of closeness? He knows that the other person expects that he would exert himself for him. In Jerusalem one turned his clasp 1:3, fol. 39a, an unexplained word עיכלה is used, in 4(2) יד אונקלי שלו. The commentary מתנות כהונה to indicates that in his Yerushalmi manuscript the word is פיבליה, identified by A. Kohut as Latin , “clasp” to hold the toga together. The Yerushalmi spelling corresponds to the late Greek form φίβλα. Kohut conjectures that on the way to a dinner one wore the clasp inverted as a sign that no other invitation could be accepted. [Babylonian sources (Tosephta 4:9, 93b) deal with preparations of the host, not the guest, for the dinner. The word appearing here, פילכיה “his distaff, spindle” does not fit.] from left to right. It was stated: “One does not carry to the mourner’s house in colored glass containers because he carries a false load27a) prescribes that all food be brought in simple baskets woven from leaves of the date palm (so that the poor also could take part in this good deed); the there must be of Babylonian origin. Colored glass is frowned upon because is looks expensive but may contain very little food since it is opaque..” It was stated 3:13–14, partially quoted in Babli 61a. Since a Jewish community is required to have organized charity, if the Gentiles do not have similar services, the Jewish social services must be offered also to the Gentiles to advance intercommunal relations. The paragraph is inserted here probably from the parallel text in 1:3, since the next paragraph is dependent on this one and belongs to : “In a town where Gentiles and Jews live together, the overseers of charity collect from Jews and Gentiles and provide for Jewish and Gentile poor, visit Jewish and Gentile sick, bury Jewish and Gentile dead, and console Gentile and Jewish mourners. Also, one takes in vessels 22:1–3). This is extended to vessels lost by Gentiles for the sake of intercommunal peace. from Gentiles and from Jews for the sake of peaceful coexistence.” The weavers asked Rebbi Ammi, what about a Gentile wedding feast? He wanted to permit it to them from this: “Because of peaceful coexistence.” Rebbi Abba told them, did not Rebbi Ḥiyya state 1:4 it is noted that one may not trade with a Gentile on the day of his wedding or the day he was appointed to a post in local government (since on these occasions religious ceremonies are unavoidable.) that the holiday of a Gentile wedding feast is forbidden. Rebbi Ammi said, if it had not been for Rebbi Ba, we would have come to permit their strange worship; praised be He Who distanced us from them.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who tells somebody who is not trustworthy, buy for me from somebody who is trustworthy, or from somebody who tithes, is If the untrustworthy emissary did not execute his job to the letter, the produce he bought is still not trustworthy; from X, he is trustworthy. If he went to buy from him and said, I did not find him, but I bought for you from somebody who is trustworthy, he is not trustworthy. HALAKHAH: It was stated 5:3; the discussion here in the Halakhah is part of the statement: “He who says to somebody who is not trustworthy, buy for me from somebody who is trustworthy, or from somebody who tithes, is not trustworthy; from X, he is trustworthy. Rebbi Yose {the Tanna, ben Ḥalaphta} says, he is not trustworthy; maybe he found a source that is closer. Rebbi Yose agrees that if he said, go, eat the loaf, and I shall pay for it, go, drink a glass, and I shall pay for it, he is trustworthy.”: “Rebbi Yose said, even if he specified, from X, he is not trustworthy, unless he said, you buy and I will pay.” What is the reason of Rebbi Yose? I say that he found someone close by and bought from him, as we have stated there 6:6. A bill of divorce is not valid until it is delivered into the hand of the wife (. 24:1,3). However, the wife can appoint an agent and the hand of a duly appointed agent is like the hand of the principal. If she is the wife of a Cohen, she may eat heave as long as she is his wife but not when she is a divorcee. Hence, the exact moment when she is divorced is identical with the exact moment in which the wife of a Cohen may no longer eat heave.: “Receive my bill of divorce at such and such a place; she may eat heave until the bill of divorce reaches that place. Rebbi Eleazar. He is the authority for bills of divorce. prohibits her immediately.” What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar? I say that he found it behind the door. It turns out that Rebbi Eleazar is like Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Yose is like Rebbi Eleazar. Rebbi Yose says more than Rebbi Eleazar; does not Rebbi Eleazar agree that if she says to him, do not accept it except at such and such a place, that she continues eating until the bill of divorce reaches that place? But here, even if he says, only from X, he is not trustworthy, except if he said, you buy and I will pay.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If someone enters a town, does not know anybody there, and asks: Who is trustworthy here, who tithes? If somebody told him, I am not trustworthy, but Mr. X is trustworthy, he may be believed. If he went and bought there and asked, who is selling old produce here 12:7). R. Abraham ben David, and Rashi ( 56b) is that the buyer is looking for old (better quality) wine and is ready to buy and tithe it if only he gets the quality desired. The interpretation of the Mishnah would be that the first informant, who directed the buyer to the second one’s store, was not an uninterested bystander, but in effect was indirectly paid for steering the stranger to the second one’s store. The plural “they may be believed” in the last sentence then would include the seller who asserted to the stranger that he was trustworthy by the rules. His trustworthiness is not invalidated by the kickback. R. Simson of Sens refers “old produce” to that grown before the Sabbatical year if the question was asked in the Sabbatical. But the question here is about tithes, not the Sabbatical. Usually, “old” refers to grain that started to grow before the last Passover, since “new” grain, summer wheat planted after Passover, may not be eaten until after the next Passover ( 23:14). But Rashi (.) shows that this notion cannot apply here and summer wheat cannot be grown in the Land of Israel.? If the seller said, the one who sent you to me, they may be believed even though they act as if they would do reciprocal favors to each other. Donkey drivers who entered a town and one of them said, my produce is new, my colleague’s is old, mine is not in order, my colleague’s is in order, are not to be believed. Rebbi Jehudah says, they are to be believed. HALAKHAH: But is a single witness trustworthy 56b).? Rebbi Joḥanan said, they were very lenient for a guest because of the necessities of life. It was stated 5:4: “He who enters a town with heave in his hand, does not know anybody there, [or stands by a threshing floor with heave in his hand] {and wants to give the heave to a trustworthy Cohen,} and does not know anybody there, may ask either or , the words of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. Rebbi says, about heave one may only ask a .” One has to interpret the in the Yerushalmi similarly, that the question is about heave. But the interpretation of the Yerushalmi, given by R. Jonah, is the opposite, that the stranger wants to know whether he may take without worry, not to whom to give. The phrase in brackets is not in the Vienna ms. of the Tosephta and R. S. Liebermann explains this as scribal omission. However, while the thrust of the Tosephta is not that of the Yerushalmi, a Yerushalmi version would not have the phrase, or does not have the phrase, as asserted by R. Jonah at the end of this paragraph. The Vienna scribe probably did not make an error here.: “He who enters a town and does not know anybody there, or stands by a threshing floor and does not know anybody there, may ask either a or an , the words of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. Rebbi says, about heave one only may ask a ” It turns out that Rebbi follows Rebbi Meïr and Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel follows his own reasoning. As we have stated there 5:4. The firstborn of a cow, sheep, or goat must be given to a Cohen. If it is without blemish, it is dedicated as sacrifice from birth. If it develops a defect, the Cohen may slaughter and eat it at home ( 15:19–23). Hence, the Cohen has a monetary interest in finding a defect in such a firstborn.: “About any bodily defects that may be caused by humans, laymen shepherds are trustworthy, Cohen shepherds are not. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, he is trustworthy about another’s flock but not his own. Rebbi Meïr said, whoever is suspect in a matter may neither judge nor testify about it.” Rebbi Jonah said, they disagree only if it is a matter of taking, but in distributing even Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel agrees. What is the difference between taking and distributing? A distribution is public knowledge. It was stated 5:5 again has a thrust opposed to the of the Yerushalmi: “If he was standing in a group of people and asked, who here is trustworthy, who here tithes? If one person told him that he himself was trustworthy, he is not trustworthy, about another one that he tithes, he is trustworthy. If they told him that this one tithes, in his presence he is not trustworthy; but in his absence, he is trustworthy; in a court of law, he is trustworthy.” The question asked against the thesis of R. Jonah clearly refers to the last clause of the Tosephta, not the quoted in the text.: “If somebody entered a town, found there groups of people, and asked, who is trustworthy here, who tithes here? If one person told him that he himself was trustworthy, and the others told him that he was trustworthy, that one is trustworthy. If they told him in the person’s presence that he was not trustworthy, he is not trustworthy; but in his absence, he is trustworthy.” Rebbi Jonah said, if that somebody was from that town, the group must be of , if he is a stranger, the group may be composed of . It is difficult for Rebbi Yose, you say that are not trustworthy in his presence to lie in this matter to please somebody? The question is not answered.? What is the reason of Rebbi Jehudah? Because of the lives of the townspeople. What is the reason of the rabbis? They can provision themselves in another town.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who buys from the baker. The seeming contradiction of this Mishnah and Mishnah 2:4 is discussed in Halakhah 2:4 and referred to again in the Halakhah here., how does he tithe? He takes the heave of the tithe and , if it can be eaten in ritual purity, has a rabbinic ratio of 2.0833% = 1/48. Today is a symbolic little piece. All must be designated (but should not actually be separated) before the declaration. and says: One percent here on that side is tithe, the rest of the tithe is adjacent to it. That which I turned into tithe is made heave of the tithe for it and the rest is . The Second Tithe is North (or South) of it and is redeemed by coins. HALAKHAH: Also ? Is due for ? Did we not state: “ of the unobservant and food containing heave are free from .” Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya, in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: This is from the House of Shammai. We have stated accordingly 1:28 we read: “Replacements for heave and its fifth {from a layman who ate heave in error, who has to replace it together with a 25% fine, measured from below, 5:16}, the fifths of the fifth {if the layman then took the fifth by error, he has to restitute it with an additional fifth, 5:26}, the leftover of the ‘ sacrifice, the two breads {leavened breads for the priests, offered on Pentecost}, the show breads, the leftovers of flour sacrifices, and additions to First Fruits; Rebbi Simeon ben Jehudah says in the name of Rebbi Simeon that the House of Shammai obligate but the House of Hillel exempt.” It is difficult to make coherent sense of this Tosephta (cf. תוספתא כפשוטה p. 206–207), but the general tenor is that the House of Shammai treat as anything that may be food for human consumption.: “Rebbi Simeon ben Jehudah says in the name of Rebbi Simeon that the House of Shammai obligate for and the House of Hillel exempt it.” Did the House of Shammai include seed goods? But he who buys for sowing or animal feed, flour for tanning or oil for lighting, is he not free from ? But it must be for somebody who kneads his dough with fruit juice However, the Mishnah, 2:4, declares that dough made with fruit juice is subject to even though it cannot become impure. [Maimonides, in his Code ( 6:12), not in his Commentary to the Mishnah, restricts the obligation of to dough made with grape juice and olive oil; he follows the Yerushalmi 2:2 which seems to indicate that practice does not follow the Mishnah.] If we follow the Mishnah in , we should require the person who buys such bread from the baker to separate in order to make public the obligation to give from such “bread.”. Did not Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina say that this follows Rebbi Eleazar ben Jehudah from Bartota 3:4: “Dough prepared with some fluid {i. e., that came into contact with some of the fluids that prepare food to become impure, cf. Chapter 2, Notes 136–137} and was kneaded with fruit juice {other than grape juice or olive oil} and was touched by a person who went to the ritual bath that day {but will be pure for heave and sacrifices only at sundown ( 22:7)}, R. Eleazar ben Jehudah from Bartota said in the name of R. Joshua that he made all of it unfit; R. Aqiba said in his {R. Joshua’s} name that he made {heave} unfit {for consumption) only at the place he touched.” Since practice follows R. Aqiba in his dispute with a single opponent, practice must be that fruit juice does not transmit impurity and, hence, does not impart impurity to . R. Eleazar ben Jehudah from Bartota, Tanna of the third generation, was a student of R. Joshua and teacher of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. The name Bartota has been tentatively identified in Upper Galilee.. R. Eleazar was known to give to charity more than he could afford, so that the administrators of charity tried to avoid being seen by him., hence it does not follow the rabbis. But it agrees with Rebbi Joḥanan, since Rebbi Joḥanan said to knead his dough in purity, he will also be careful with heave and tithes, and the baker should tithe. If he prepares his dough in impurity, the buyer should tithe, and this is the case here. R. Eleazar holds that the Mishnah means a wholesaler, who does not have to tithe, but Mishnah 1:3 deals either with a retail baker or a private person baking for his family and guests., one case for him who works in purity and one case for him who works in impurity. But what following Rebbi Eleazar, since Rebbi Eleazar said, in both cases if he works in purity? It must be that he is a guest. Was it not stated.: “He who is trustworthy for purities is trustworthy for tithes?” Rebbi Yannai ben Rebbi Ismaël stated and said: That is, if one is his guest, but for the public he is not trustworthy unless he accepts it publicly. And here we deal with the public. Rebbi Abin, Rebbi Shammai, in the name of Rebbi Aḥa, understood this from the following is subject to the laws of but that the 1% for heave of the tithe is to be measured only after regular was taken.. “He who wants to separate heave and the heave of the tithe together.” As you will say there, except for that which may become sanctified as heave, here also except for that which may become sanctified as . We have stated between First and Second Tithes together, and only then to give a name to Second Tithe and to redeem it. Both tithes should have been given when the grain was first stored at the farm barn. The obligation of comes much later, when grain is first made into flour and then the flour into bread dough.. Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: This means that is not subject to “do not give too late you should not give too late,” . 22:28. From this one concludes that a person who gave heave of the tithe before the first heave cannot declare that he followed all the rules of tithing. No similar rule seems to exist for ..” Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: The Mishnah is not formulated in sequence, do we not deal with is in itself in the wrong order.? Did not Rebbi Abba, son of Rebbi Ḥiyya, say in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan that the Mishnah deals with ; hence, not with certain produce is irrelevant, that one may separate the heave of the tithe (which is part of the First Tithe) after the Second Tithe. R. Joḥanan notes that this is one of the special leniencies for .? And here we deal with . Rebbi Ḥiyya stated 5:6: “He who wants to separate heave, heave of the tithe, and together …” There the order of the declaration is heave, heave of the tithe, , Second Tithe. Since the first heave is mentioned, one speaks about produce from which nothing at all was yet taken. Nevertheless, appears between First and Second tithes.: Also for certain. On that, Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Zeïra said, this means that is not subject to “do not give too late.” Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: The Mishnah is not formulated in sequence, should not precede the First Tithe has the status of heave, once the obligation has started it should take the place of heave that be given before any tithe.? Then should be subject to tithes but not tithes to , because everything that precedes another, the other is obligated for it should be taken from dough made from grain from which heave and tithes were taken would be put on its head.. And we have stated in this respect 4:10. It follows that heave and are coordinate, not subordinate one to the other. Hence, each of them needs to be put in order with respect to the other. But definitely this should give a status prior to tithes.: “He who makes dough from , whether he takes before heave or heave before , what he did is done. should not be eaten until he take heave for it, heave should not be eaten until he separate for it.” But why does First Tithe have precedence? Because it started at the threshing floor. But does the Second Tithe not start at the threshing floor? Rebbi Mattaniah said, it would have been logical that should precede everything else, i. e., comes after heave.. Why does First Heave have precedence? Because it started at the threshing floor and it is called “beginning 18:12. also is called “beginning” ( 15:20,21) but its obligation does not start at the threshing floor..” Second Tithe, even though it started at the threshing floor, is not called “beginning.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who wants to separate heave and heave of the tithe together takes one in thirty-three and one third 1:7, fol. 40d) that all heave may be given by estimate and that heave of the tithe may also be given by the owner himself, not only by the Levite who is the recipient of the First Tithe. Since the heaves are given by estimate, one has to increase the amount somewhat, to 3% or 1 in 331/3. and says: One percent of what is here on this side is profane and the remainder is heave for everything. The profane here on that side is tithe; the rest of the tithe is adjacent to it. That which I have declared as tithe is made heave of the tithe for it, (the rest is ,) the Second Tithe is either North or South of it and is redeemed by coins. HALAKHAH: “ 5:6. He who wants to separate heave, heave of the tithe, and together takes for heave, heave of the tithe, and , that is one in 20 is 1/48 of the dough (in our case, of the grain), or 2.0833% of the remainder, 2.02125% of the original amount. Hence, the total taken should be 5.00125% of the original amount, not 5% as stated in the Tosephta. However, 1/800 of one percent is not a quantity that is verifiable by eyesight; as the Halakhah will state later, it is disregarded. Also, it is required that both heave and be given by estimate, by measurement; hence, the natural error in such an estimate is much larger than the small overshoot we should require for the heave of the tithe, as indicated in the Mishnah. Today, when no heave can be eaten in the absence of the ashes of the red heifer, both heave and are given in minute amounts to avoid destroying food. The modified declaration for putting in order , produce bought on a market in Israel, can be found in most of current prayer books printed in Israel. Produce sold by the farmers’ cooperative in Israel (but not produce for export) is all tithed., and says: One percent of what is here on this side which also is a heave. is profane and another one in 48 next to it; the remainder is heave for everything. The profane which is in it and that which I made profane is made tithe; the rest of the tithe is adjacent to it. That which I have declared as tithe is made heave of the tithe for it is missing. It should be deleted from the Mishnah and inserted here., the Second Tithe is North or South of it and is redeemed by coins.” Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: He has to recite five benedictions Rebbi Ḥiyya prescribes a collective benediction: Praised are You, Eternal, our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us to separate heaves and tithes. (Maimonides 1:17).. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: He subsumes them all in one benediction. So far for a Cohen or a Levi 18:26): “You also shall separate the heave of the Eternal,” and explained in . #120. He and the Levite are owners both of the grain and the tithe, and can separate both heave and heave of the tithe. However, an Israel should not be owner of the tithe; how can he ever give heave of the tithe?, but an Israel? If he will declare heave of the tithe, does he not separate for something that is not his? If one gives tithe and after that heave, one has preceded. First heave and after that tithe, might he not give too little tithe or add to his tithe? As we have stated 8:13; there the text is similar but the statements are switched in error., he who gives too little tithe, his tithes are in order but his produce is damaged, if he gives too much tithe, his tithes are damaged but his produce is in order. Rebbi Yose said, he relies on a stipulation by the Court. What is the stipulation by the Court? As far as one’s mind might err. What is a stipulation by the Court? That one should fix the First Tithe to the North, Second Tithe to the South, and the heave of the tithe at the extreme North. What is a stipulation by the Court? It is that if the Second Tithe is redeemed, that which is in excess is also redeemed. All this refers to dry produce; for fluids? If somebody had 100 figs, 50 large ones and 50 small ones. If he takes from the large ones, should he take nine? If he takes from the small ones, should he take eleven? If he takes ten large ones, there might be one profane among them and we would worry lest perhaps he use that one to make it heave of the tithe for another place, but it is written ( 18:26): “The heave of the Eternal, tithe from tithe,” not profane from tithe. Rebbi Abun bar Cahana said, he stipulates and says, the tithe due from this produce should be fixed from the tip of each stem und continue until it reaches; in each of the ten there is heave of the tithe and a tiny bit of profane. That takes care of large quantities. If there was little, if he had ten figs, five large ones and five small ones? If he takes from the large ones, he has to take one minus, adv., “too little, not enough.” a little. From the little ones, he has to take one plus a little. If he took one of the large ones, it contains a little bit of profane and one has to worry that maybe he turns that profane part into heave of the tithe for another place, and it is written ( 18:26): “The heave of the Eternal, tithe from tithe,” not profane from tithe. Rebbi Abba from Carthage said, he stipulates and says, the tithe due from this produce should be fixed from the tip of each stem and he marks it and says to the Cohen, as far as where I marked it. “What is here on this side is profane is understood to qualify “profane.” The question is, why is the language of the declaration so involved, and could it not be simplified by omitting this step?.” Why does he not say, what is here on this side is tithe? He would precede. Why does he not say, that on this side is heave? It would turn out that either he diminishes or increases the heave, 10% can be declared to be tithe following the stipulation of the Court mentioned earlier and the stipulation will cover any deviation from the exact 1% for the grain actually separated from the harvest.. Since he says, what is here on this side is profane , whether he diminishes or increases the heave does not matter.",

Rebbi Jehudah forbids it; I say that the wheat of yesterday was from one source and today’s is from another.. Rebbi Simeon forbids for heave of the tithe and permits for becomes obligated at the baker’s; hence, everybody will agree that all bread from one baker can be fixed with one . It follows that R. Jehudah, who does not mention , will agree, and if R. Jehudah and R. Simeon disagree, R. Simeon must be the more restrictive since he forbids all tithing from one batch to another, even of the same day.. HALAKHAH: How long? A student of Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, up to 30 days. How is that? If he bought from him at the beginning of 30 days, in the middle, and at the end. The first and the second are one kind, the first and the third are two kinds. “Rebbi Simeon forbids for heave of the tithe and permits for .” Then Rebbi Jehudah forbids for for different batches from the same bakery.. Does it not become at his place starts when he makes his dough and only depends on the baker’s actions.? But perhaps he borrows impure sour dough to make his bread-dough who does not care whether his food is ritually pure or not as long as it is not dedicated to the Temple. But the does not take the heave of the tithe seriously, so we are back to the situation described by R. Jehudah that one batch of flour is from a source which was tithed, the other from a source not tithed.. Even so, does it not become at his place.? But perhaps he borrows an impure loaf baker. to fill up his oven. If he borrows an impure loaf to fill up his oven, must he then not tithe every single loaf on its dough and after baking the loaves are indistinguishable; one may not separate heave () from a loaf already put in order, and there would be no way out but to take from every single loaf and not from one for all.? That is for Rebbi Joḥanan, since Rebbi Joḥanan said, there if he works in purity, here if he works in impurity. But for Rebbi Eleazar, who says that in both cases if he works in purity for all?? Rebbi Yudan, the father of Rebbi Mattaniah said, we refer to one who works in impurity and it becomes at his place, and Rebbi Jehudah also agrees. We have stated accordingly: “Rebbi Jehudah and Rebbi Simeon forbid for heave of the tithe and permit for .” Hence, Rebbi Jehudah forbids for heave of the tithe and permits for ; Rebbi Simeon forbids for heave of the tithe and permits for . What is the difference between them? In the opinion of Rebbi Jehudah, one may not separate from today’s for yesterday’s or from yesterday’s for today’s, but one may separate from one oven batch on another oven batch. In the opinion of Rebbi Simeon, even from one oven batch on another one may not separate.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who buys from a poor person, and similarly, the poor to whom bread slices or pieces of fig cake were given, tithe from each piece separately. But he mixes together dates and dried figs and then gives. Rebbi Jehudah said, when is that? If the gift is large. But if the gift is small, he tithes from each single one. He who buys from the grain wholesaler and later buys from him a second time should not tithe from one batch for any other, not even if they are from the same crate, not even if they are the same kind with rabbinic permission, his statement may be believed.. But the grain wholesaler is trustworthy to say that they are from the same source. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Pedaiah, Rebbi Jonah in the name of Ḥizqiah, there is no mixing except for wine and oil 13b. It probably means that only fluids can be tithed when mixed because fluids from different sources quickly diffuse and material from each source is contained in every volume element in the fluid.. Rebbi Joḥanan says, they can be mixed up to the size of olives. Our Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “But he mixes together dates and dried figs and then gives 4:8). R. Simson in his commentary requires that figs and dates be mashed together into cakes. This contradicts both the Yerushalmi and the Mishnah, because mashed figs are not גרוגרת but דבילה.}.” He explains it up to olive-sized bits. Rebbi Yose was never under this rule. in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: They permitted for following Rebbi Jehudah, since “Rebbi Jehudah says, when is that? If the gift is large. But if the gift is small, he tithes from each single one.” In the House of Rebbi Yannai they said: The Mishnah speaks of threshing time allow for special leniencies. But if not all farmers at the place give in equal amounts, the poor recipient must split his gifts into packets corresponding in size to the smallest packet he received, and if this consists of a single fruit he must tithe all his gifts singly (or, giver by giver.) [The Tosephta ( 5:9) has another explanation, that “big gifts” are given only in years of a bumper crop; in that case, everybody may be assumed to tithe.], when everybody was giving from a hundred . If all were giving from a hundred but one only from fifty, he must tithe from fifty. If all were giving from fifty but one only from forty, he must tithe from forty. If all were giving from forty but one only from thirty, he must tithe from thirty. If all were giving from twenty but one only from ten, he must tithe from ten. If all were giving from ten but one only from one, he must tithe every single one. Rebbi Jeremiah asked: Even if he declares the buy to be good? “That wheat I bought from you yesterday was good!” “These are the same!” It was stated: “He who buys from the retail merchant and returns to buy a second time. If he recognizes that the amphora is the same, he tithes from one on the other 5:11, has an opposite statement: “He who buys from the retail merchant and went back and bought a second time, even if he recognizes the amphora that it is the same, he may not tithe from one on the other.”.” But if he does not recognize it, he does not. That means, in the case of , but not in the case of vessels (used to draw wine) which usually are refilled one from the other.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who buys from a farmer and then buys from him a second time tithes from one batch for the other, even if they are from two crates, even if the are from two different hamlets is a formality for all his produce. If he does not tithe, all his produce needs tithing and it is possible to tithe from one for the other.. If the farmer sells vegetables on the market, in case that his supply comes from his own vegetable gardens, one tithes from one for all others, from other vegetable gardens, one has to tithe each bunch separately. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Jonah asked: According to Rebbi Meïr, should he not tithe each stem separately? As we have stated there 6:2: “All bundled vegetables on the market are impure. R. Jehudah declares the fresh ones pure. R. Meïr said, why did they declare them impure? Only because of spittle!” The first Tanna holds that on the market one sprinkles water on the vegetables to keep them fresh. Hence, they are subject to impurity and, since everybody touches them, we must assume that an unclean person may have touched them and treat the vegetables as impure. R. Jehudah disagrees for those fresh vegetables which do not need refreshing; hence, they are not subject to impurity and it does not matter who touched them. R. Meïr restricts the impurity to bundles; since in binding them the farmer will have taken the string into his mouth the bundle was wetted intentionally, and, unless the farmer is a , the bundle will certainly be impure. If the farmer is a , the bundle still will probably become impure on the market.: “Rebbi Meïr said, why did it become impure? Only because of spittle!” As you will say, there it is usual to open bundles and he binds using his mouth, but here, is it usual to open bundles to risk having the outer ones inside and the inner ones outside? Rebbi Jonah said, not only from his own vegetable gardens, but even from vegetable gardens of others, if they tithe under his instruction without worry., he tithes from one for the other, but if they do not, he has to tithe each bunch separately.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who buys from two sources may tithe from one for the other even though they said that nobody is permitted to sell except in case of need arises if some grain that was tithed fell into a heap of In that case, heave can no longer be taken from that heap, because what one takes out may be from the profane grain and cannot become heave. Then it is necessary to take the heave for this heap from some other heap. But nobody can take heave for another person’s property. Hence, a transfer of property may be necessary..

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: One tithes from a Jew’s produce for that of a Gentile and from a Gentile’s for that of a Jew; from that of a Jew for that of a Samaritan, and from that of a Samaritan for that of a Samaritan. Rebbi Eleazar 5:22), the statement and the reasoning behind it are attributed to R. Eliezer (ben Hyrkanos); this is reasonable there since his opponent is his contemporary, R. Ṭarphon. prohibits from that of a Samaritan for that of a Samaritan. A flower pot with a hole is like earth. If he gave heave from the earth for a pot with a hole, or from a flower pot with a hole for produce of the earth, his heave is heave. From a pot without a hole 7:6, fol. 31a.) But since it is not heave from the Biblical point of view, heave must be taken a second time from the produce subject to heave. for one with a hole it is heave‘ (Tosephta 5:25, Yerushalmi 7:6)., but he must take heave a second time. From a pot with a hole for one without a hole and heave and tithes must be removed. The rest should be treated as heave by rabbinical decree, as in the previous case., it is heave that should not be eaten unless heave and tithes were taken for it 89b, it says “heave and tithes from another place,” considering it similar to ‘. This definitely is not the position of the Yerushalmi.. If he took heave from one for other , or from for certain produce, it is heave, but he must take heave a second time. From certain produce for was tithed, the heave taken would remain Hence, it must be treated as if it were certain , it is heave that should not be eaten unless heave and tithes were taken for it. HALAKHAH: The Mishnah 4:12, Babli 47a; there the dispute is between two Amoraim, Rabba (in Babylonia, holding that Gentile land is subject to tithes) and R. Eleazar (in Galilee, holding that the Gentile’s land is free from tithes.) The verses quoted also are totally different. Tosaphot 47a, s. v. אמר רבה) prove that in the opinion of the Babli, R. Meïr frees Gentile land from heave and tithes except if it is leased to a Jewish sharecropper. In Tosephta 5:21, the position of R. Meïr is the same as here, the opposition consists of R. Jehudah, R. Simeon, R. Yose. The Tosephta is quoted in Babli 66b; there, R. Meïr and R. Jehudah agree with R. Meïr here; R. Simeon and R. Yose oppose. In the interpretation of the Babli , the disagreement is not about the status of the Land; it is universally held that ownership of real estate by a Gentile does not free the Land from its obligations. Rather, it is the ownership of the grain at the moment the obligation of heave and tithes starts, i. e., when the grain is stored. Since a Gentile is not subject to the laws of the Torah, R. Simeon and R. Jehudah hold that his grain cannot be subject to those laws. Cf. also , Chapter 4, Notes 129–131. is Rebbi Meïr’s, since Rebbi Meïr says that a Gentile may not acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to remove it from tithe; Rebbi Jehudah and Rebbi Simeon say, a Gentile may acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to free it from tithe. Rebbi Immi in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: The reason of Rebbi Meïr (25:46): “You shall transmit them by inheritance to your sons after you, to inherit by the rules of real estate.” This brackets real estate with slaves. Just as you may buy slaves from them but they cannot buy from you 46a, this is derived from the verse 25:45: “ ‘Also from the children of the inhabitants that live among you, from them you may buy;’ you, but not they.” As a matter of practical law, since the Jewish buyer of a non–Jewish slave is required to convert him, and the slave then is subject to the commandments of the Torah; if his owner would sell him to a Gentile, the slave automatically would go free., so real estate you may buy from them but they cannot buy from you. Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yose said before Rebbi Yasa, the following supports Rebbi Meïr ( 25:23): “The land shall not be sold permanently, because the land belongs to Me,” absolutely, 4(8): לצמיתות לחולטנית, “permanently means absolutely.” See R. Shaul Israeli, ספר ארץ חמדה Jerusalem 1999, p. 195 ff.. He said to him, that in itself supports Rebbi Simeon. “It shall not be sold”, because if it was sold, it would be sold absolutely. The Great Rebbi Ḥuna from Sepphoris said, Rebbi Ḥanina instituted in Sepphoris following Rebbi Simeon. Rebbi Zeïra said, Rebbi Ḥanina instituted in Sepphoris following Rebbi Simeon. Rebbi Zeïra said before Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: Even though Rebbi Meïr says that a Gentile may not acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to free it from tithes, he agrees here that he may acquire property rights. Rebbi Abba said, in order to eat its fruits. Did we not state: “The buyer4:9. The Jew who bought agricultural land in Israel from a Gentile can bring its First Fruits to the Temple even though this is not his inheritance from the land distribution by Jouhua. For Rebbi Meïr, who holds that possession by a Gentile cannot change the status of the Land relative to the duties imposed on it by the Torah, it should be clear that just as heave and tithe were not lifted from the Land, so the duty of First Fruits was not lifted. Why then is the bringing of First Fruits classified as a rabbinical ordinance, “for the good of the world,” in order to encourage people to buy land in Israel, and not as original Biblical obligation? brings First Fruits for the good of the world.” Why does he not bring it as a Biblical obligation? Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: He who buys loose produce from a Gentile separates heave and heave of the tithe as a matter of practice, gives it to the tribe, and receives money from the tribe 11b). Since heave and heave of the tithe may be eaten only by Cohanim, presumably they will make a very low offer for the food, but they must pay.. But he who buys produce still in the ground from a Gentile separates heave and heave of the tithe as a matter of practice, gives it to the tribe, and does not take money from the tribe. What is the reason? ( 18:26) “If you remove the tithe from the Children of Israel.” From the Children of Israel you remove the tithe, but not from the acquaintances of Cohanim or Levites#26): “From the Children of Israel you remove the tithe, but not from Cohanim or Levites.” In that case, the quote has no direct connection with the discussion here.. From the Children of Israel you remove the tithe, but not from the hand of a Gentile 11b) reports in the name of R. Joshua ben Levi that only heave, not heave of the tithe, must be given as a matter of practice. This is a serious disagreement between the two Talmudim.. Rebbi Aḥa said, in the days of Rebbi Hoshaiah they wanted to vote on King’s Mountain, to free it from tithes. They said, let Rebbi Hoshaiah come. Before he could come, the opportunity was lost. Rebbi Judah ben Pazi in the name of Rebbi Hoshaiah: Practice follows Rebbi Simeon. Otherwise, we would say, between Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Simeon, practice does not follow Rebbi Simeon 46b, the question about whose opinion prevails remains unanswered. In rabbinic tradition ( p. 490, see the sources quoted there, note חֹ), between R. Meïr and R. Simeon practice follows the one who is more restrictive. However, R. Asher ben Yeḥiel (, 2, #34) holds that between R. Meïr and R. Simeon practice follows R. Simeon.. But because it was stated: “Rebbi Simeon from Shezur said, once some produce that was was mixed up with my produce. I asked Rebbi Ṭarphon, and he told me: Go and buy from a Gentile and tithe for it.” On that we have stated: “Rebbi Jehudah and Rebbi Simeon say, a Gentile may acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to free it from tithe.” Lest you think that this case has two opposed by two 46b, Yerushalmi 3:1, fol. 42a, 4:1, fol. 30b), and even if one agrees to count R. Jehudah with R. Meïr as in the Babli text, R. Yose has precedence over R. Jehudah (Babli 46b, Yerushalmi 4:11, fol. 6a).]. Therefore, he had to say that practice follows Rebbi Simeon. In addition, from the following: Rebbi Zeïra said, Abba the Anatolian bought produce from an Aramean; he came before Rebbi Judah ben Levi who sent his son Menaḥem to put it in order; he gave him his tithes. When he returned, Rebbi Joshua ben Levi met him and said, who else but your father would do such a thing? The arguments of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi are inverted. There, he says that he who buys loose produce from a Gentile, separates heave and heave of the tithe as a matter of practice, gives them to the tribe, and receives money from the tribe; and here he says so! Rebbi Abba bar Zamina said before Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Simon does not say so, but when he returned, Rebbi Joshua ben Levi met him and said, this does not belong to your father. Rebbi Zeïra was offended. Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Tanḥum bar Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, three may tithe without permission: He whose was mixed with profane produce produce. Hence, any farmer who uses his own produce to take care of his neighbor’s problem, does his neighbor a great favor and we are justified in decreeing that the neighbor’s consent is implied and he does not have to be asked beforehand. “Permission” in the text means consent by the owner of the produce.. And he who buys from the division of the Samaritans 3:4 explains that in Temple times, in Judea everybody has to be believed in matters of ritual purity of wine and olive oil used in the Temple. This implies that in Galilee only are trustworthy. The reason is explained in Halakhah 3:4 (fol. 79c), because “the division of Samaritans” separates Judea from Galilee and it is impossible to bring wine and olive oil in purity from Galilee to Judea (since Samaritans, like Gentiles, do not bury still-births in cemeteries but anywhere at roadsides, and one cannot exclude the possibility that one might step over such a grave which imparts the impurity of the dead to wine and oil.) [In the Babli ( 25a), it is asserted that a strip of Gentile land separates Galilee from Judea.] The division of the Samaritans therefore is the region of Samaria inhabited exclusively by Samaritans and produce from there is certainly in all respects. Anybody who removes heave from this produce and turns it into regular removes a hidden stumbling block from the unwary buyer.. Rebbi Zeïra said, this implies that he does not take money from the tribe. If you say that he takes money from the tribe, he tithed with permission! Rebbi Joḥanan said, the reason of Rebbi Eleazar: Just as they declared the produce of the Land of Israel notwithstanding the majority farmers did tithe, there would have been no need for Now that there is , we have to worry that the bunch before us is not in order but all others, the greater part, are in order. Therefore, may not be tithed from one batch on the other. and one may not give heave or tithe from one for the other, so they declared the produce of Samaritans certain, notwithstanding the majority one may not give heave or tithe from one for the other. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: They declared a pot to be of doubtful status. But did we not state: “A pot with a hole sanctifies in the vineyard 7:8. The language is from 22:9: “Do not sow two kinds in your vineyard, lest the fullness of the seeds that you are sowing together with the yield of the vineyard be sanctified.” Sanctified here means that it becomes like dedicated sacrifice, forbidden for all use; קרבן “sacrifice” has the same meaning in non-sacrificial context (Mishnah , 15:5)., a pot without a hole does not sanctify in the vineyard.” Because of doubt 5:16).. Just as you say, “from certain produce for , it is heave that should not be eaten unless heave and tithes were taken for it,” should one say so also for “from one for other ? probably is in order, why should the two cases have different rules?” Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac, this means that a case of doubtful is like a case of doubt about heave of the tithe from ; it is free from the rules of certain produce, containing the forbidden heave of the tithe. Here all the leniencies of given in the first two chapters do apply..",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: He who receives a field as sharecropper from a Jew, a Gentile, or a Samaritan, distributes in their presence. He who leases a field from a Jew separates heave and delivers to him. Rebbi Jehudah says, when is that? When he gives from that field and from that kind. But if he gives from another field or from another kind, he must tithe and give him. He who leases a field from a Gentile tithes and delivers to him. Rebbi Jehudah says, also he who is a sharecropper for a Gentile on a field that used to belong to his family tithes and delivers to him. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Joḥanan said, these are the words of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. But the words of the Sages are: From a Jew, he splits; from a Gentile, he gives heave. We have stated 6:1: “He who receives a field as sharecropper from a Gentile tithes and gives to him. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, what if the Gentile does not want to tithe his produce? But he distributes and gives before him.” It is clear that the Yerushalmi does not speak about a lease for a fixed amount, because then the Gentile would not be interested in what the Jewish tenant does, but about a sharecropper who will diminish the landlord’s part if he gives heave or tithes prior to distribution.: “He who leases a field from a Gentile separates heave and then gives to him. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said: If the Gentile does not wish to give heave, I have no right to it, but he distributes and puts it before him.” Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Yannai ( 18:28): “You, also you,” to include your plenipotentiary shall lift, , the heave of the Eternal.” The expression is superfluous; since “also” always means an addition, “also you” means a stand-in. Since he is titled “also you”, it follows that he takes the place of the person authorizing him. The same explanation is given in 1:1 (fol. 40b/c), Babli 41b, 22a.. Just as you are in the covenant, so your plenipotentiary must be in the covenant. You appoint a plenipotentiary, the Gentile may not. Rebbi Yasa wanted to say that the Gentile cannot appoint as plenipotentiary another Gentile, but he can appoint a Jew. Rebbi Zeïra said, from the itself: You appoint a plenipotentiary, does that not mean Jews? Similarly, the Gentile cannot appoint a plenipotentiary, not even a Jew. Rav Hoshaia objects: Does the support Rebbi Joḥanan? “Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said: If the Gentile does not wish to give heave from his produce, he cannot give heave” Rebbi Abba said, if he confirms it after him 1:15: “If a Gentile separated heave for a Jew, even with his permission, it is not heave. … Rebbi Isaac says, if a Gentile separated heave for a Jew and the owner confirms his action, it is heave.” For a Jew, once permission is given, it does not require an additional action on the part of the owner. But the Gentile’s action is not valid unless it is explicitly confirmed by the Jewish owner afterwards; the Gentile does the mechanical work and the Jew gives the separated amount the status of heave.. “ ‘He who leases,’ means he pays in produce, ‘he who rents,’ means he pays money, ‘he who receives,’ as sharecropper for a half, a third, or a quarter 6:2.”. So far a Gentile; a Samaritan? Let us hear from the following 7:25: “He who gives a field to a Gentile sharecropper, a Samaritan, or to somebody who is not trusted with tithes, even though one is not permitted to do so, he has to tithe for him.” Here the obligation to tithe seems to be a kind of fine imposed upon someone who does not let his field to a trusted Jew. If it is imposed on someone who gives his field to a sharecropper, on him who leases his field to a Gentile.: “He who gives a field to a Gentile sharecropper, a Samaritan, or somebody who is not trusted with tithes, before they come to the time of tithes he does not have to tithe for him; after they come to the time of tithes he has to tithe for him.” That is, at a place where Jews are present. At a place where no Jews are available? Let us hear from the following: Rebbi Simon had fields at King’s Mountain 1:9, fol. 40b.. He asked Rebbi Joḥanan, who told him: Let them lie fallow, but do not lease them to a Gentile. He asked Rebbi Joshua ben Levi who permitted it to him. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi is of the opinion that a place where no Jews are available has the status of Syria Chapter 7, Note 119. The argument implies that Neḥemiah’s covenant applies only to those regions of the Holy Land outside the immediate neighborhood of Jerusalem actually settled by Jews. The territory subject to tithes and Sabbatical therefore is variable over time [S. Klein, HUCA 5(1928) 197–260.]. For Syria, we hear from the following: Rebbi Ḥaggai descended into Homs. The family Astor asked him: Since no Jews are available here, we lease to Gentiles; do we have to tithe for them? He sent and asked Rebbi Zeïra. Rebbi Zeïra asked Rebbi Immi, who told him that they did not have to tithe. From this you hear that the rules of leasing follow Rebbi Yose 1:9: “One does not lease houses in Israel to Gentiles, not to mention fields. In Syria one leases to them houses but not fields, and outside the Land one sells them houses and leases fields to them. These are the words of Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Yose says, even in the Land of Israel one does lease houses to them and in Syria one sells to them houses and leases fields to them. Outside the Land one sells both to them.” Since one may lease fields to Gentiles, the act of leasing does not remove a field from the duty of tithes. Hence, there is no such duty on the field itself and the Gentile’s part does not have to be tithed by the Jewish landlord. The Yerushalmi’s decision is repeated in Babli 21a.. Also from the following: Rebbi Ḥanina, the son of Rebbi Abbahu, said my father had a case; he sent and asked Rebbi Ḥiyya, Rebbi Yasa, and Rebbi Immi, and they taught him that the rules of leasing follow Rebbi Yose; hence, as far as tithing for them is concerned, they do not tithe for them. “If 1:6. The rule applies both to the sharecropper and to the lessee. Since the preceding Tosephta states the rules for sharecropper and lessee of a Jewish landlord, it follows that this Tosephta (and the one discussed in the following paragraph) deal with a Gentile landlord, which fits in the context of the present Halakhah. he received a field to harvest for wheat, grapes to harvest for wine, olives to harvest for oil, he tithes before he delivers.” Come and see: Before he sows, he separates heave; after it was sown, he tithes? Rebbi Ḥinena said, they made a special decree for the sharecropper, so that the Land of Israel should not lie fallow. But here it is already sown. “If 1:6. In this case, the payment is given before any obligation of heave and tithes was incurred. he received a field to harvest for early ears, grapes to harvest for baskets of grapes, olives to harvest for baskets of olives, he delivers as is.” That means, if (he is paid) in the same kind; but from another field, or from that field but not from the same kind, he must tithe before he delivers. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated 1:5.: “From the same field, whether it be the same kind or another kind, he separates heave and delivers. From another field, whether it be the same kind or another kind, he tithes and delivers.” The Mishnah follows Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel; what Rebbi Ḥiyya stated follows the Sages, and they disagree. We also may come and state that the Mishnah deals with some place where barley usually does not yield twice as much as wheat 9:8): “He who receives a field to sow it with barley should not sow it with wheat; wheat, he may sow it with barley. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel forbids it.” In the opinion of the Yerushalmi, this depends on the relative cash value of the crops raised; if barley yields enough to offset its cheaper price relative to wheat, the lessee is permitted to change the crop. “The Mishnah” in our text means the opinion of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, representing actual practice. [In the opinion of the Babli (106b), wheat needs a more frequent crop rotation and lying fallow than barley and the landlord can always object.] Tosephta 9:32, dealing with the subject matter of Mishnah 9:8, does not mention the point of view of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel.; what Rebbi Ḥiyya stated refers to a place where barley usually yields twice as much as wheat. There you say, he separates heave and delivers to him. Here you say, he tithes and delivers to him. The colleagues in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The Sages fined the one who leases from a Gentile but they did not fine the one who leases from a Jew. Rebbi La in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The strict law, or any observant Jew, should not deliver any produce not completely tithed to a third person. applies to him who leases from a Gentile but not to him who leases from a Jew. One supports one and one supports the other. One 5:2: “He who leases a field from a Gentile must tithe before delivering to him. Hence, if the lessee bought from a Gentile, or the Gentile sold his crop to another Jew, it is .” The anonymous author of the Tosephta is R. Meïr in our supports the colleagues. “He who leases a field from a Gentile separates heave and delivers to him. Rebbi Meïr says, he tithes and delivers to him.” Could the rabbis say, the Sages fined him who leases from a Gentile but they did not fine him who leases from a Jew? How can a fine apply to leasing from a Jew? But so it is: The rabbis say, the strict law applies to him who leases from a Jew, but Rebbi Meïr said, the strict law does not apply to him who leases from a Jew. One supports Rebbi La: “He 5:2: “He who splits the yield of a field with a Gentile tithes before delivering the Gentile’s part. Rebbi Simeon says, he separates heave and delivers the Gentile’s part. Hence, if the Gentile converted or sold to another Jew, he has to tithe before delivering.” (R. S. Liebermann explains that Tosephta as dealing with the problem of retroactive clarification, ברירה, but that explanation is impossible since heave and tithes are due only at storage time, see מנחת ביכורים In general, the commentaries on the entire paragraph rely too much on unsupported emendations to be taken seriously.) who leases a field from a Gentile tithes and delivers to him. Rebbi Simeon says, he separates heave and delivers to him.” Could the rabbis say, the strict law applies to him who leases from a Gentile, but the strict law does not apply to him who leases from a Jew; Rebbi Simeon said, the strict law does not apply to him who leases from a Gentile? Can anybody make such a statement? But so it is, the Sages fined him who leases from a Gentile but they did not fine him who leases from a Jew. Rebbi Simeon said, the Sages did not fine him who leases from a Gentile; hence, if the Gentile converted or sold to another Jew, it is permitted. Him who says that the law applies, one can understand. He who says, they fined in the Babli ( 101a), with מציק instead of מסיק (identical sounds in Galilean dialect; Babylonian spelling as a rule is more historically correct.)? Rebbi Joḥanan said, one has stated this only in the case of oppressors. Since you say so to him, he exerts himself and buys the land back.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: A Cohen or a Levite who received a field (as sharecroppers) share in the tithe in the same proportion as they share in a profane yield. Rebbi Eliezer says, the tithe is theirs because they came because of it. HALAKHAH: The rabbis object to Rebbi Eliezer: How did they acquire? He said to them, do you not agree with me that if they agreed 7:1) authorizes that kind of stipulation. among themselves, tithes go to the workers? Even if they made a condition, how did they acquire? If there is nothing said, it is as if somebody said: Harvest from this land so that its tithes should be yours. They said to him, there is no stipulation here; if nothing is said there is no stipulation. It is as if he said, harvest this land on condition that you take one tenth for yourselves. It was stated 7:1: “An Israel {a Jew who is neither Cohen nor Levite} who received {as sharecropper} a field from an Israel, a Cohen from a Cohen, a Levite from a Levite, divide among themselves.”: “A Cohen from a Cohen, a Levite from a Levite, an Israel 7:1: “An Israel {a Jew who is neither Cohen nor Levite} who received {as sharecropper} a field from an Israel, a Cohen from a Cohen, a Levite from a Levite, divide among themselves.” from an Israel, split the tithes.” Who needs this statement? Rebbi Eliezer; even though Rebbi Eliezer says that the tithe is theirs because they came because of it, here he agrees that they divide up the tithes. “An 7:3–4, one reads: “An Israel who received a field (as sharecropper) from a Cohen, if he said to him, on condition that the tithes be mine, or yours, or mine and yours; this is forbidden. A Cohen who received a field (as sharecropper) from an Israel, if he said to him, on condition that the tithes be mine, that is permitted. That they be yours, or that they be mine and yours, if he received it under the standard sharecropping contract, it is permitted, otherwise it is forbidden.” Israel who received a field (as sharecropper) from a Cohen, if he said to him, on condition that the tithes be mine, or yours, or mine and yours; this is permitted. A Cohen who received a field (as sharecropper) from a Cohen, if he said to him, on condition that the tithes be mine, that is permitted. That they be yours, that is forbidden. That they be mine and yours, that is forbidden. If he received it under the standard sharecropping contract, it is permitted, otherwise it is forbidden.” Even without that, do not the tithes belong to them tell us as new information?? But so it must read: “My part is mine, your part is mine and yours, if he received it under the standard sharecropping contract, it is permitted, otherwise it is forbidden.” “If an Israel received (as sharecropper) a field from another Israel on condition that the tithes go to a certain person, that clause is forbidden; on condition that I shall take them and deliver them to a certain person, that clause is permitted. 7:1) there is a positive prescription that between sharecropper and landlord of similar status, tithes must be evenly split. There is no prescription on how the tithes should be given to Levite or Cohen.” Is the second version not identical with the first? Rebbi Aḥa said, “if you agree” makes the difference. Rebbi Yose said, you say it is permitted if it follows the standard sharecropper’s contract. You say it is forbidden if it does not follow the standard sharecropper’s contract. It turns out that Rebbi Yose holds with Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Aḥa with Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina. As Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina said, a person gives his tithes for the benefit of goodwill 64b–65a); hence, if the Cohen takes heave without consent of the owner, he cannot be sued for monetary damages (Maimonides 12:15). This is the only opinion mentioned in the Babli and the only one in (6). (Starting here, the next four paragraphs are also found in 2:10.). Rebbi Joḥanan said, a person may not give his tithes for the benefit of goodwill. What is the reason of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina? ( 5:10) “Everybody shall be the owner of his holy things.” What does Rebbi Joḥanan with this? He may give them to whomever he likes (6)].. A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥaninah: “A vow that no Cohanim or Levites should have any advantage from me, they should take against his will 3:11. This is one of the vows the husband cannot dissolve if made by his wife since dissolution is unnecessary; any recipient of the obligatory gifts to Cohen and Levite may take them by force in this case, and the owner has no monetary gain. It seems to disagree with R. Joḥanan who says that the owner has the choice of recipient. But since the owner does not want to give what he is obligated to, he transgresses commandments of the Torah and the situation can be saved only by others disregarding his rights..” He explains it about a person who says, I cannot possibly give them gifts. You should know that this is so, since we have stated: “ Cohanim and Levites, let others take.” A disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “An Israel can say to another Israel, here you have a tetradrachma and give this first born to my daughter’s son, a Cohen27a) a similar statement is made for future heave. Both statements are taken together in Tosephta 5:18: “An Israel may say to a Cohen {it seems that it should read: another Israel, but there is absolutely no manuscript evidence for that} here you have a tetradrachma and give heave to my daughter’s son, the Cohen, or give a firstborn to my daughter’s son, the Cohen.” The Babli does not want to accept the statement about the firstborn since the Cohen might think the tetradrachma is redemption money and the firstborn does not have to be treated as a sacrifice..” He explains, if he already wanted to give it to two Cohanim and that daughter’s son was one of them; then one said, here you have a tetradrachma and give all of it to my daughter’s son, a Cohen. They asked before Rebbi Zeïra, in that situation, a Cohen to an Israel, what is the rule? At Rebbi Yose’s they said that he did not answer. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Aḥa said, so he said to them: In the opinion of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina, why is a Cohen to an Israel forbidden, not because it looks badly? Also Rebbi Joḥanan holds that from an Israel to an Israel it is forbidden because it looks badly. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, there is desecration of sacrifices and you said because it looks badly? Because of the following, as it was stated: 5:20, a slightly longer version. “Cohanim and Levites who help at the threshing floor have no right either to heave or to tithe, and if the farmer gave, it is desecrated, as it is said (Lev. 22:15): ‘They should not desecrate the sanctified things of the Children of Israel,’ but they desecrate them! In addition, they said and he has to give its heave and tithes to another Cohen. This is made explicit in the Tosephta. that their heave is no heave, their tithes are no tithes, their dedications are no dedications, and about them the verse says (Micha 3:11): ‘Their heads judge for bribes and their priests come for a price.’ The Omnipresent brings over them three catastrophies; that is what is written (Micha 3:12): ‘Therefore, because of you Zion will be ploughed over as a field, etc.’” A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan 2:10.: “If somebody marries giving heave, tithes, ‘gifts’ 18:3). They are profane food and may be sold by the Cohen to anybody., water for sprinkling, or ashes of the red heifer 58b)., she is married, even if the groom is Israel.” He explains it with heave he inherited from his maternal grandfather, a Cohen. “ 7:14; there the condition is that the buyer be trustworthy for tithes. A similar , dealing with a Levite selling to an Israel, is in Babli 63a. Since a Cohen is required to separate heave and tithes but is permitted to take them for himself in order to eat the heaves in purity, his heaves are a kind of lien on the field and he may sell the field without selling the lien. If a Cohen sold a field to an Israel and made the condition that the tithes should be his, the tithes are his.” May he sell them to a Cohen? Let us hear from the following. Rebbi Abbahu said in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: He who sells the tithes of his field to another person did not do anything, the future children of his slave girl to another person, he did not do anything, the fetus of his animal to another person, he did not do anything, the airspace of his dry land to another person, he did not do anything 64b, 212.). But he may sell him a field and reserve the tithes for himself, a slave girl and reserve her children for himself, an animal and reserve her fetus for himself. Is it not impossible for a person to sell the airspace of his dry land to another person? Explain it if he tells him, tear out some grasses in that dry land to acquire its airspace. And here there is real estate before him and he says, pluck something from the ground so that you acquire one tenth of it. “ 7:14; there the condition is that the buyer be trustworthy for tithes. There is no mention of heirs other than sons. A similar , dealing with a Levite selling to an Israel, appears in Babli 63a. Since the Cohen may stipulate before the sale, he may stipulate anything he wishes. If a Cohen sold a field to an Israel on condition that the tithes should be his, the tithes are his. If he dies, his sons have no right to the tithes. ‘For me and my sons, for me and my heirs,’ his sons have the tithes, his heirs have the tithes.” Rebbi Yudan bar Shalom asked before Rebbi Yose: So far only for heirs whose claim is from the Torah? Even for heirs whose claim is not from the Torah! “ 7:14, the text is R. Ḥiyya’s. A similar , dealing with a Levite selling to an Israel, appears in Babli 63a, also following R. Ḥiyya only. That all tithes should be mine as long as you own it, he gets its tithes as long as the buyer owns it.” When he sold it to a third party, he has no tithes. If the buyer then bought it back from the third party, Rebbi Ḥiyya states that he has no tithes, Rebbi Hoshaia states that the tithes are his. This disagreement turns out like the other disagreement, as we have stated there 9:13: “A woman who presents two letters of divorce and two collects two Two and one letter of divorce, or one and two letters of divorce, or one , one letter of divorce, and a death, she collects only one since ‘he who divorces his wife and then remarries her, remarries her on the basis of the first .’ ” The is explained in , Chapter 3, Note 151. The individual stipulations are obligations the groom takes upon himself in addition to the obligatory “that he who divorces his wife and then remarries her, remarries her on the basis of the first .” Rebbi Ḥanin 9:13 (fol. 33c), is his only known halakhic statement. stated before Rebbi La: Two Amoraïm, one says for but not for individual stipulations, and the other says, both for and individual stipulations. For him who says, for but not for individual stipulations, he has the tithes and one bill of divorce. If one assumes that the argument of the Mishnah applies only to the obligatory , she collects the amount of one obligatory but both individual stipulations; hence, the remarrying does not eliminate the validity of the first In our case, the repurchasing of the field does not eliminate the first contract and the Cohen re-enters into his rights to tithes. (The Babli, 90a, which does not consider the case of presented by R. Hoshaia, holds that if the date of the letter of divorce is between the dates of the two , she collects both in full.). For him who says, both for and for individual stipulations, he has no tithes is invalidated completely, as is the Cohen’s contract of sale. (This is the only case considered by the Babli, 63a.). But did we not state 7:9; there it is spelled out: בת כהן.: “If somebody received (as sharecropper) from the daughter of a Cohen, she has the tithes. If she married an Israel, they split the tithes. If she was widowed or divorced 22:13)., she returns to her prior status.” There when he sold, here when he received. But did not Rebbi Ḥiyya state: “When she sold? is not in the Tosephta. R. Ḥiyya, who holds that the Cohen loses all his rights when the Israel sells the field to a third party, states that the daughter of a Cohen who sells her field to an Israel while retaining her rights to tithes, and who loses half of the tithes on her marriage to an Israel, can reclaim all her rights as a childless divorcee or widow. The problem is to reconcile the two statements of R. Ḥiyya; the answer is that in the second case the rights of the seller are only suspended, not eliminated.” Rebbi Samuel bar Eudaimon said, there it left the power of both parties; here, it left the power of the seller but not that of the buyer. “A7:15. Cohen who sold a field to an Israel on condition that the tithes be his for four or five years can oppose the buyer’s planting it as a vineyard for the first three years and its fruits forbidden for all use, the Cohen would lose most of the tithes he had contracted for., sowing woad, a plant used to make dark blue dye. Since woad is not food, it is exempt from tithes and the Cohen would lose all income from the field., or turning it into a field of reeds. Mine forever, he cannot oppose the buyer’s planting it as a vineyard, sowing woad, or turning it into a field of reeds.” There came a case before Rebbi Aḥa bar Ulla and he obligated him to turn over to him one tenth of the reeds. “If an 7:15, the first two sentences only. Israel sold a field to a Cohen on condition that the tithes be his for four or five years, it is permitted. Forever, it is forbidden, since no Cohen can make a Cohen. If a Cohen sold a field to an Israel on condition that the tithes be the Israel’s for four or five years, it is forbidden.” There you say it is permitted, here you say it is forbidden! There, he gave him rights to something he had the right to dispose of, here, he gave him rights to something he had no right to dispose of.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If somebody receives olives to make oil, they split heave just as they split the profane. Rebbi Jehudah says, if an Israel received olives from a Cohen or a Levite for oil or for half the yield as his wages, the tithes are for the landlords. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Jehudah treats olives like fields but the rabbis do not treat olives like fields. Now it seems that Rebbi Judah is thinking like Rebbi Eliezer, as Rebbi Eliezer says, “the tithe is theirs because they came because of it.” So here, if a Cohen or a Levite received a field (as sharecroppers), the tithes are theirs because they came because of them. “ 7:10. As explained later in this paragraph, the technical term “to put in care” is applied only to an animal that is the joint property of the rancher and an investor. A cow of a Cohen that was put in an Israel’s care and gave birth to a firstborn calf, the firstborn calf is the Cohen’s, the words of Rebbi Jehudah. But the Sages say, the firstborn is their common property. Rebbi Jehudah said to them, do you not agree with me that the tithes of his field are his? They said to him, because the body of the field is his property, but the body of the cow is joint property. If the body of the cow were sole property of the Cohen, the firstborn would be the Cohen’s.” We have stated accordingly, “ means joint responsibility, is the sole responsibility of him who gives.” “If a 7:7. In this case, the Cohen is the owner and heave and tithe are his. The tithe, after heave of the tithe is removed, is profane in the hand of the Cohen and he may give them to anybody he wishes, even an Israel. Cohen gave money to an Israel to buy produce for half the profit and he (the Cohen) said to him: If they go up or down in price, it is on my account, and the tithes are yours, this is permitted. If an 7: 8. The Israel is the owner of everything, the Cohen is only his agent. Heave and tithes may not be part of the payment, otherwise the Cohen’s standing would be that of a Cohen helping with the harvest; see Halakhah 3 above. Hence, the Cohen has to be paid in full before heave and tithe are given to him. Israel gave money to a Cohen to buy produce for half the profit and he (the Israel) said to him: If they go up or down in price, it is on my account, and the tithes are yours, if he had paid the wages, it is permitted, otherwise it is forbidden. An 5:18. R. Saul Lieberman conjectures that “sold” really means “leased his olive trees for one year,” to be paid a fixed amount of olive oil as rent. One may assume that olives growing on trees are meant, to be harvested and pressed by the contractor. In that sense, “sold” is applicable. Israel who sold olives against 60 of . If one said to him, sell them to me and I shall give you 60 that are in order, that is permitted. 60 , and both of us will share in the tithes, that is forbiden.” If he gives him everything, it is permitted, if he gives him half, it is forbidden? Rebbi Yose said, if he extends credit to him of oil immediately after they are pressed but only later, while another bidder would have to deliver promptly, not only does he give to the Israel landlord part of his tithes as hidden interest for the extension of credit but he uses tithes (of which heave of the tithe has not been removed and which still retains its holy status) to pay a debt and this is contempt of holy gifts. [In the Tosephta dealing with the first case, the Cohen who delivers 60 of tithed oil, it is stated explicitly that there is no transgression either of the laws of interest or of those of honoring holy things.]. We also have stated in this respect: If he extends credit to him it is forbidden because of interest and because of degradation of holy things.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: The House of Shammai say, one should sell one’s olives only to a will prepare his olive oil in ritual purity. The House of Shammai forbid causing impurity to food grown in the Land of Israel, but the House of Hillel permit this after the destruction of the Temple.. The House of Hillel say, also to one who tithes. But the modest ones of the House of Hillel used to follow the words of the House of Shammai. If two people put the yield of their vineyards into one wine press and one tithes but the other does not, then he who tithes must tithe his own and what could be his at any place. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Joḥanan said, the reason of the House of Hillel is that people eat from their olives while they are being loaded into the oil vat, as a subterfuge. The House of Hillel follow their own opinion, as we have stated 5:8. The first sentence is labelled as opinion of the House of Shammai in the Mishnah. The House of Shammai argue that nobody would buy cattle trained for ploughing in a Sabbatical year unless he intends to use it then.: “One should not sell him a ploughing cow in the Sabbatical year, but the House of Hillel permit this because he may slaughter it.” Do people really slaughter their cattle? As a subterfuge. They agree that one may sell ears of grain for dough even though one knows that the buyer will not prepare the dough in purity. It was stated 3:13.: “They agree that one does not sell a wheat stack, a grape vat, or an olive vat 9:1: “When do olives become susceptible to impurity? When they start oozing sap in the vat but not in boxes, following the House of Shammai. Rebbi Simeon says, the term for oozing is three days. The House of Hillel say, if three olives cling together. Rabban Gamliel says, when the work is complete {i. e., if no more olives are added to the vat}, and the sages accept his position.” to anybody but a or to somebody who is known to process in purity.” Is the grape vat not from the Torah? This does not disagree with Rebbi Joḥanan; just as Rebbi Joḥanan said, the little one is a restriction 80a on Mishnah 3:8: “If a toddler was found with a piece of dough near a dough made in purity, that dough is pure in the opinion of R. Meïr, impure in the opinion of the Sages, since toddlers will grab everything they see.” On this R. Joḥanan notes that the impurity is rabbinic and one may not burn heave if it was made impure in this way. “Little one” then would refer to a toddler. According to R. Moses Margalit, the statement refers to Mishnah 3:1: “All handles of food which would transmit impurity from its original source transmit impurity for . Food that is almost separated, R. Meïr says, if he takes a large piece and a small one is lifted with it, the small piece goes with the large one. R. Jehudah says, if he takes a small piece and a large one is lifted with it, the large goes with the small one. R. Neḥemiah says, that refers to purity, the Sages say, to impurity.” In this case, “small one” refers to a piece of food and R. Joḥanan notes that the restrictive attitude of the Sages represents a rabbinic decree, not an interpretation of Biblical law. {A “handle” of a fruit is an inedible part by which the fruit may be moved, such as the stalk of a pear or an apple. The stalk is wood and not subject to impurity, but as handle it transmits impurity both from an impure person to the fruit and from an impure fruit to any person handling it. The detailed rules are spelled out in Tractate . means a person who had been impure, had immersed himself in water for cleansing, and now is in an intermediate state until sundown when he will be pure (. 22:7). In the state of , any heave or sacrifices he touches become unusable; the Mishnah discusses transmission of that disability.}, so “vat of olives” is a restriction. Rebbi Ḥizqiah said to Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah: They disagree about connections. Because everywhere “biting” is a connection, squeezing is not a connection. But here even squeezing is a connection 9:1, if the olives are squeezed so that three cling together as one clump, their sap prepares for impurity and the olives are enabled to receive impurity in the Biblical sense.; hence from the Torah they are enabled. Rebbi Jonah met Rebbi Jeremiah and asked him, did you say that? He said, that is not from me, even their enablings are restrictions. Did we not state: “They agree that one does not sell a wheat stack, a grape vat, or an olive vat to anybody but a or to somebody who is known to process in purity?” Is the grape vat not from the Torah? Then the olive vat should be from the Torah! What about this? Explain it following Rebbi Meïr, since Rebbi Meïr said, sap is counted as a fluid. Rebbi Zeïra said, the reason of the House of Shammai is that a should never sell olives to anybody but one who tithes before selling, since a is always bound by the rules of the trustworthy person.. Who are the modest ones? Those of noble conduct. Rav Ḥisda said, here we have taught that those of noble conduct are called modest. : Rebbi Eleazar said, this follows Rebbi Meïr, since Rebbi Meïr said, they permitted to sell only to the grain wholesaler. He explains the Mishnah: The one who tithes must tithe his own part as certain, and that part of his which could be spread anywhere as . Rebbi Jonah objected: He sells it as certain and tithes only , since it is required that everything be completely in order.? It is only possible in the way Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Mishnah is the word of everybody: The one who tithes must tithe his own part as certain, and his part anywhere as ; that means one half of his part in his partner’s hand as (assuming that both of them put exactly the same amount of grapes into the press; otherwise, he tithes an amount proportional to his partner’s share in the whole.).",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If two people received a field as sharecroppers or inherited it or bought it as partners, one can say to his partner, take your wheat on this side and I shall take on that side, take your wine from this side and I shall take from the other side. But he should not say to him, take the wheat and I shall take the barley, take the wine and I shall take the oil but to money matters. In his opinion, a splitting of the first kind, designating parts of the same crop for the benefit of either party, can be enforced in court on condition that it not hurt the other party, but a proposal of the second kind, exchanging rights to different kinds of crops, will not be supported by a court. To oppose a settlement that benefits one party without being in any way detrimental to the other is called “sin of Sodom.” According to R. Simson of Sens, all this deals with the laws of ; in a division of the first kind, this is simply a necessary splitting of produce. The agreement must have been reached before the harvest, when no heaves and tithes were yet due. Hence, “wine” and “oil” must mean “grapes” and “olives;” nevertheless the unequal splitting is forbidden because it too closely resembles a sale that is questionable if one of the partners is a and the other an The position of Maimonides seems to be more acceptable since the inheritance of and is treated in the following.. If a and an inherited from their father, the may say, take your wheat on this side and I shall take on that side, take wine from this side and I shall take from the other side. But he should not say to him, take wheat and I shall take barley, take the moist produce and I shall take the dry aspects of the situation discussed above. The splitting is permitted since each partner is taking his own. This ruling follows the position taken in the Babli (107a) as practice that brothers who split an inheritance cannot be considered as buying from one another. It is as if each of the brothers received what was bequeathed to them even before their father’s death. However, if they switch barley for wheat or oil for wine, they certainly have to be considered as buyers from one another and a is not permitted to sell anything not fully tithed to an The would have a natural inclination to take dry produce not subject to ritual impurity. [In Tosephta (6:8) even the splitting according to different places is forbidden if one side is pure and the other impure, since for the these are two different kinds.]. HALAKHAH: It was stated 2:10. The status of Syria is explained in , Chapter 7, Note 119.: “If a Jew and a Gentile bought a field in Syria, it is as if and tithed produce were mixed together, the words of Rebbi. Rebbi Simeon ben Gamliel says, the Jew’s part is obligated, the Gentile’s part is free.” Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: When do they disagree? If they split the field while the grain was standing. But if they split grain stacks, even Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel will agree with Rebbi that every single stalk belongs to the partnership. Rebbi Jonah said, Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: When do they disagree? If they split the field while the grain was standing. But if they split sheaves, even Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel will agree with Rebbi that every single stalk belongs to the partnership. According to Rebbi Jonah, what is the difference between stacks and sheaves? If he harvests a small amount and shares with his partner. Rebbi Hoshaia said, that is, if they bought with the idea that they would not split. But if they bought with the idea that they always would split, Rebbi will agree with Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel that his part already belonged to him from the first moment. Rebbi Yose said, the words of the rabbis disagree since Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan said that partners are the subject of the disagreement between Rebbi and Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel1:7, 9:3, about the tithes on newborn calves and lambs and the to be paid the agents of the Temple when the yearly Temple tax of one-half was due (fee for the banker, amounting to 1/24th of the coins exchanged, to exchange half-sheqels into full sheqels.) Partnerships are not subject to tithes on animals or to the ; partners contribute full sheqels that need no exchanging. The Mishnah states at both places that the rules for and tithes are opposite. If heirs never divided up the inheritance, they are subject to tithes because the flock is still their father’s, but are free from because they pay as one entity. If they divide the inheritance and afterwards form a new partnership they are free from tithes as partners but subject to because each one pays for himself. Rebbi Joḥanan points out that the rule on the undivided inheritance is not accepted by everybody.. Are brothers who split not like these partners?",

After they came into the proselyte’s possession, this is forbidden. He who sells produce in Syria and says: ‘They are from the Land of Israel,’ must tithe them. ‘They are tithed,’ one believes him because the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits. ‘They are from my field,’ he must tithe them. ‘They are tithed,’ one believes him because the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits. If it is known that he has a field in Syria, he must tithe. HALAKHAH: a Jew and a Gentile bought a Gentile’s house and found there idols, libation wine, and coins, he should not tell him, take the idols and libation wine, and I shall take the coins.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, not only idols, libation wine, and coins, but even if there were two idols, one shaped as a tripod and one not shaped as a tripod, he should not tell him, take the one that is not shaped as a tripod and I shall take the one shaped like a tripod.

But our Mishnah disagrees: “Take the idols and I shall take money, take the wine for libations and I shall take produce.” But the end shows that there is no disagreement: “After they came into the possession of the proselyte, this is forbidden;” here, from the moment he acquired it it is as if it entered into his possession 64a.. “Aquila the Proselyte 6:13. Aquila was a student of Rebbis Eliezer and Joshua and the author of a very literal translation of the Bible. He did not avail himself of the permission given in the Mishnah but took his share of the idols (or their price) and threw them into the Dead Sea, which was the ultimate way of making sure that nobody would derive any benefit from them. split with his brothers; he restricted himself and brought his gain to the Dead Sea.” Three Amoraïm; one said that he brought the price of the idols to the Dead Sea, another said that he brought the price of his part in the idols to the Dead Sea, and another said that he brought the idols themselves to the Dead Sea, in order to remove them from his father’s house.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: An who said to a , buy for me a bunch of vegetables, buy for me a loaf, if he buys anonymously, he is free, he is not under the obligation to tithe before he delivers the goods. (Explanation of R. S. Lieberman.). If he says, this one is for me’s property before delivery and must be tithed. and that one is for my friend, if they became mixed up he has to tithe, even if there are a hundred. HALAKHAH: : There 8:2. There, everybody knows that the person is poor; hence, it is not the mouth which forbade the produce, asserting that it was not tithed, that could permit it without tithing as gifts to the poor. Nevertheless, the Mishnah asserts that the poor can be trusted., we have stated: “They can be trusted about gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and at harvest time.” And here you say so? There, his assertion is for exemption, but here his assertion is for obligation. And we have stated so is not found in parallel sources, but a similar statement appears in the quote from the Tosephta in the next paragraph.: “If his assertion is for exemption, he may be trusted in restrictions.” But here, he can be trusted even if his explanation is to make it easier. It was stated 5:2: “A Gentile who was calling out, ‘come and buy fruits, they are from Azeqa, from an tree, from a vineyard in its fourth year,’ cannot be believed because he intends to advertise. But if he says, ‘I bought them from a certain Gentile,’ he is to be trusted for restrictions, the words of Rebbi. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, he cannot be trusted since the words of a Gentile are irrelevant.”: “A Gentile who was calling out, ‘come and buy fruits from me, they are from an tree 19:23)., they are from a vineyard in its fourth year 7:6.,’ cannot be believed. If he says, ‘I brought them from a certain Gentile,’ he may be trusted for restrictions, the words of Rebbi. The Sages say, the words of a Gentile are irrelevant.” Rebbi Judan asked, what if he calls out when he is uninformed? Rebbi Judan asked, what if one holds that a Samaritan is like a Gentile, since they disagreed: “A Samaritan is like a Gentile, the words of Rebbi. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, a Samaritan is like a Jew in all respects 3:4, 7:1.”? Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, that is only if most of what he takes in comes from his own. If a Jew had a sharecropper who, in general, cannot be trusted in matters of tithes. But since in Syria most produce on the market comes from Gentile farmers who are exempt from tithes, it is to be assumed that the fruits come from a Gentile source and are permitted without tithing. in Syria who sent him fruits and said that they were tithed; I say that he bought them on the market, if that kind is found on the market. Not only if he does not grow that kind on his field, but even if he does grow that kind on his field; since that kind is found on the market it is permitted. Our Mishnah follows Rebbi Yose, as we have stated: “He who buys anonymously has to tithe that explain the situation. Tosephta 8:1: “If an said to a , buy for me a bunch of vegetables, buy for me a loaf, Rebbi Yose says the does not have to tithe, Rebbi Jehudah says he does.” Babli 37b: “If an said to a , buy for me a bunch of vegetables, buy for me a loaf, Rebbi Yose says the does not have to tithe, but the Sages say he does.”.” What are we talking about? If he said to him, go and buy for me, he is his agent who had commissioned him.; go and buy for yourself, they are his property. There seems to be no place for the disagreement between R. Yose and R. Jehudah.. But in our case nothing was spelled out. Rebbi Jehudah says that the seller wants the person who buys to get the property rights, Rebbi Yose says that the seller wants the owner of the money to get the property rights. Therefore, if he added a piece 98b. There, Rashi refers to Tosephta ; it should read: Yerushalmi ., Rebbi Jehudah says, it belongs to the buyer, Rebbi Yose says, it belongs to both of them. The argument of Rebbi Yose seems to be inverted. There he says that the seller wants the owner of the money to get the property rights, and here you say so 98b, gives a different answer: If the unit price of the merchandise is fixed, then any addition is a gift and is jointly owned. If the unit price is not fixed, then the additional amount is part of the sale and totally belongs to the owner of the money.? Here the transaction is through the money of one and the feet of the other, therefore they split. It was stated 8:1. If the buyer took the coin for himself, it becomes his property and he owes the original owner money. Hence, if he buys, he acquires the merchandise and as a , he has to tithe.: “Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, if he exchanged the coin he has to tithe.” Rebbi Yose said, this means that if somebody gives coins to another person to exchange them, when they are lost the recipient is answerable for their alienation. Samuel says, if he distributes it himself did not acquire the ’s part and might not have to tithe.. Rebbi Eleazar said, only if he took his share last might have to tithe only his own share if he took it last.. Rebbi Jonah said, both statements are necessary. If he buyer who never acquired the produce destined for the and is not responsible for it. distributes it himself and took his share first he only has to tithe his share. If he who bought resolved in his mind that all produce would be the ’s except the last bunch that would be for himself. did not distribute it but took his share last, he only has to tithe his share. It was stated 5:14, 8:10, quoted in Babli 63a, where, however, the second case is formulated so that the employer offers to pay the store for the purchases of the employee. The version discussed here, that the employer guarantees the employee’s expenses, is also in Yerushalmi 2:1 (fol. 62c), together with the interpretations of Rebbis Zeïra and Hila (Illa, La).: “One may say to his worker worker would buy produce grown in the Sabbatical year which is forbidden for commercial transactions, or food and not tithe it. Since the money was given beforehand, it is spent on the responsibility of the worker alone.: Here you have a denar, use it for food, here you have a denar, use it for drink, and not be worried about either the Sabbatical year, tithes, or wine for libations. But if he told him, go and buy yourself a loaf and I shall give you the money, go and buy yourself a of wine and I shall give you the money, he has to worry because of the Sabbatical year, tithes, and wine used for libations.” Rebbi Zeïra said, the grocer becomes the plenipotentiary of the employer to let the worker acquire. Rebbi Hila said, the worker acquired for the employer from the grocer 8b, as explained in חידושי הרשב״א .) and then acquires it himself. What is the difference between them? If the grocer was deaf-mute. According to Rebbi Zeïra, he does not have to worry because a deaf-mute cannot become a plenipotentiary; according to Rebbi Hila, he has to worry. It was stated 6:4: “A Jew should not say to a Gentile, a Samaritan, or to one who cannot be trusted with tithes, here you have 200 and pay for me to the treasury, but he says to him, free me from the treasury. Similarly, a person should not say to his friend, here you have 200 and pay the , but he says to him, separate me from the .” The parallel is in Babli 71a.: “A person should not say to his friend, here you have 200 and pay for me to the treasury, but he says to him, free me from the treasury. Similarly, a person should not say to his friend, here you have 200 and pay the , but he says to him, free me from the .”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If somebody invites his friend for a meal but the latter does not trust him with tithes, the friend should say on Friday eve: That which I will separate in the future shall be tithe, the rest of tithe near to it. That which I made tithe shall be the heave of the tithe for everything, and the Second Tithe shall be to the North (or South) and be redeemed by coins, one-eighth of an obolus, must be deducted from the value of the coin. If all value has been used, the coin should be destroyed.. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Joḥanan said: The Mishnah deals with . Hence, not with certain produce or produce from which heave was taken but one is certain that no tithe was taken.? A Mishnah 2:7, but the discussion here shows that the execution of a tithing plan already spelled out on Friday may be permitted. says, even for certain produce, as we have stated there: “If he had figs in his house and he was in the House of Study or on the field.” If you want to say that we deal with , you cannot do so, since it is stated: “If it was .” What Rebbi Joḥanan said was that it deals with . He did not say, not with certain produce, but that this Mishnah deals with ; he did not state that provisos can only be made for . Hence, the problem lies not in the possibility of a proviso but in its nature.. What is the difference between and certain produce? For , a person may make a proviso for something that is not in his possession; for certain produce, he may only make a proviso for something that is in his possession. Rebbi Yannai had made a proviso for certain produce 93a, reports that his sharecropper used to bring him fruits every Friday afternoon, and that time he was so late that R. Yannai got nervous and made a proviso since the fruits would spoil if not eaten on the Sabbath.) Since provisos for certain produce were mentioned last, they are discussed first.. He asked the Great Rebbi Ḥiyya, may one fix this on the Sabbath? He said to him (. 14:23): “That you should learn to fear the Eternal, your God, all the days,” including the Sabbath 93a/b, the verse is taken to prove that one should make provisos so that certain produce on the Sabbath does not diminish one’s enjoyment of the Sabbath (interpretation of Rashi).}. How did you see a way to be so lenient, my initiative 15:4) used to check whether a load of grain does not hide taxable goods.] depends on me! He said to him, in the future you will carry leadership in Israel. Rebbi Hoshaia had made a proviso for certain produce. One woman cooked vegetables she had forgotten to put in order. She came to Rebbi Hoshaia who sent Zavdi ben Levi to put it in order for him and for her. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal asked, would Zavdi ben Levi not have to give Rebbi Hoshaia property rights on these vegetables? Rebbi Zeïra asked, where do we hold? If his proviso was meant for him and for others, he does not have to give him property rights on the vegetable. If his proviso was not meant for him and for others, he has to give him property rights on the vegetable. Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: It was answered, Zavdi ben Levi did not give Rebbi Hoshaia property rights on the vegetable.. Rebbi Yannai said, he must remember his proviso. Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, he must whisper with his lips. Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Zeïra: Is he not like somebody who makes repairs on the Sabbath? He said to him, because of his proviso. Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Zeïra: Is it not forbidden because of destruction of edibles? He said to him, he crumbles a small amount and eats. Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Zeïra: Is it not forbidden because of robbery and, hence, is not claimable in court).? He said to him, the host desires the satisfaction of his guest. The words of the rabbis disagree since Rebbi Samuel bar Rebbi Isaac said: Rebbi and Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah were guests of a private person. Evil rumors told the latter, watch out, they are suspecting you! He sat near them and was watching them.. They pretended to throw food against each other and in that way were putting the food in order. Does he not desire their satisfaction? He does, but he does not want to be suspected.. It was stated 8:5: “R. Jehudah said, can a person make a proviso about something not in his possession? But Rebbi Jehudah agrees that he may go and buy from the place from which his host bought.” Since the argument is Amoraic in our text, the Tosephta must represent a Babylonian edition.: “Rebbi Jehudah forbids.” What is the reason of Rebbi Jehudah? Can a person make a proviso about something not in his possession? “But Rebbi Jehudah agrees that he may go, buy from the place from which his host bought, and tithe.” Can a person give for something that is not his? Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: they considered him as one who sold produce to another person, as was stated 3:7, in slightly different language but identical meaning. R. Jehudah’s restriction that the tithing must be from the same source as the is not mentioned.: “He who sells produce to another person has to run after him and put the produce in order. If he does not find him, if it is known that the produce still exists, he has to tithe for him; if not, he does not have to tithe for him. If it is doubtful whether the produce exists or not, he tithes for it and gives a name to the tithes.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: When they mixed him a cup, he says: What I shall leave at the rim of the cup shall be tithe, the rest of tithe near to it. What I made tithe shall be the heave of the tithe for everything, and the Second Tithe shall be on its top and be redeemed by coins. HALAKHAH: So is the Mishnah: Concerning the mixing of the cup. Where are we at? If he says it beforehand, the drink is mixed. If he says, when I shall have drunk, before that he drank .. What we are dealing with is that he says beforehand: When I shall have drunk. On the other hand, he cannot designate heave before he finished, in order to avoid drinking heave. Hence, he has to designate heave on Friday to be separated after he finished drinking.. But does he then not move impure heave on the Sabbath’s, all the food is considered impure. Hence, the heave also is impure and must be destroyed. But this cannot be done on the Sabbath; the impure heave is therefore of no use on the Sabbath and under the rules of cannot be moved.? Rebbi Eleazar said, he leaves some profane, as what we have stated there 21:1: “One moves impure heave with pure and with profane food.” It seems that the switch impure/pure in our text is a scribal error since the following argument requires the order of subjects in the Mishnah. In the parallel 3:3 (fol. 30a), the quote of the Mishnah is correct. {Because of that switch, successive editors have mutilated the text in newer editions.}: “One moves pure heave with impure one and with profane food.” But that does not compare. There, the impure is for the needs of the pure3:3 (fol. 30a) has exactly the same text. The explanation of the Yerushalmi seems to be the same as that of the Babli ( 142a), that impure heave can be moved on the Sabbath only if it is necessary to remove it in order to get at usable food, be it pure heave or profane., but here the profane is for the needs of the impure. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, when he sets down the cup it will be holy. There, we have stated 8:7, this is R. Meïr’s opinion, restricted to somebody who bought on Friday and had no time to tithe it before sundown.: “Is somebody buys wine from the Samaritans.” It was stated 8:7. R. Meïr’s position is he never had a case of a broken wine bag; he would worry if a bag broke and was emptied without some drops remaining that could be designated as heave of the tithe.: “Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Simeon forbid it, for the wine bag may spring a leak and it will turn out retroactively that he drank .” Is our Mishnah not following Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Simeon? Rebbi Jacob bar Idi said, all agree that the cup is at its place.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: A worker and has to be fed by his employer during the day. who does not believe his employer takes one dried fig. and says: This one and the next nine shall be tithe for ninety that I shall eat. This one is made heave of the tithe for them. The Second Tithe is at the end and it is redeemed by a coin in a coin.. He saves one fig. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, he should not save because he reduces the work he will be able to do for his employer. But Rebbi Yose said, he should not save because that is a stipulation of the Court. HALAKHAH: Rebbi Eleazar 2:4, where the text is identical except for בטילה instead of בטיבולה. The Mishnah in assumes that somebody gives a to a Levite and a to the poor; according to R. Meïr then he, or his worker, can eat eight based on the tithes he gave. The Sages permit only to eat according to the percentage of the tithe that still exists. Maimonides and R. Simson give two possible interpretations, one that the Mishnah there is a corollary to the Mishnah here and deals with a worker who receives food from his employer and sees the employer give to the Levite and the poor but does not know whether he gave as tithes or as gifts. R. Hoshaiah declares that the position of the Sages in that Mishnah is identical with the position of the Tanna in our Mishnah. in the name of Rebbi Hoshaiah: They considered him a worker who does not trust his employer. The following is obvious: If the produce was burned, the heave is . If the heave is burned, when the produce is eaten the heave will have been sanctified retroactively. What did he save? From his food he separates the heave of the tithe. It was stated‘ 8:2: “A worker is not permitted to work for himself at night and rent himself out during the day, or plough with his cow in the evening and rent her out in the morning; he should not starve himself, torment himself, or give his food to his children, because he robs his employer of the work he will be able to do.”: “A man should not plough with his cow at night and rent her out during the day, he should not work for himself at night and rent himself out during the day, he should not starve himself and not torment himself because he reduces the work he will be able to do for his employer.” Rebbi Joḥanan went to some place where he found the schoolteacher weak on Maimonides 13:6 reads אטימוס, ἄθυμος “feeble” (M. Sachs), in Chap. 39, אטמיאס. The translation follows . He asked them, what has happened? They said to him, he is fasting. He said to him, that is forbidden to you. If one says that it is forbidden for the work one does for flesh and blood, so much more for the work of the Holy One, praise to Him! Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi in the name of Rav 8:6: “R. Yose says that it is a stipulation of the Court that the heave of the tithe should be from the employer and the Second Tithe from the worker.” R. Simson reads the text of the Tosephta in the Yerushalmi. Chap. 39 quotes the Tosephta, not the Yerushalmi. Maimonides 9:11 follows the Tosephta as current practice. It seems that the Yerushalmi gives the position of the anonymous Tanna, in contrast to the Tosephta which explicitly refers to R. Yose; the reading in the Yerushalmi should not be changed for the (probably Babylonian) Tosephta. Rav explains the position of the anonymous Tanna as practice; he must assume that Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel and R. Yose disagree, so both are single opinions that are disregarded in face of a majority.: It is a stipulation of the Court that the heave of the tithe should be from the worker and the Second Tithe needed to redeem the second tithe. from the employer.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If someone buys wine from Samaritans he may say: Two that I shall separate in the future are heave, ten tithe per one hundred, but one does not require him to go into details. Similarly, Second Tithe should be 10% of the remaining 89.2 ., and nine Second Tithe; then he redeems from a designated coin; the redemption is effected by his declaration. and drinks. HALAKHAH: It was stated 8:7: “If someone buys wine from Samaritans on Fridays and he forgot to tithe, he may say: Two that I shall separate in the future are heave, the next ten tithe, and the next nine Second Tithe; then he redeems and drinks immediately; the words of R. Meïr. R. Jehudah, R. Yose, and R. Simeon forbid it. They said to R. Meïr, do you not agree that if his wine bag would spring a leak he would drink ? He said to them, if it would spring a leak.” R. Jehudah is not mentioned in the Halakhah; since he is the senior among those who disagree, the argument with R. Meïr is his and does not obligate the other two authorities who agree with R. Jehudah on the practical rule but not on the theoretical reason. Note that in the version of the Tosephta, the wine bag is already transported to the buyer’s house and, therefore, the risk of the bag springing a leak is minimized.: “Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Simeon prohibit to do so, maybe the wine bag will spring a leak and it turns out retroactively that he drank .” But the reason of one is not the reason of the other. The reason of Rebbi Yose is that maybe he will pour.. The reason of Rebbi Simeon is that maybe he will forget and drink the remainder. As it was stated 3:17: “If somebody said, the Second Tithe in this container should be redeemed by that , and he did not define its place, R. Simeon says, he gave it its rightful name {and it is redeemed.} The Sages say, {it is not redeemed} until he says, at the North or South end.” The next Tosephta shows that the “Sages” here follow the opinion of R. Yose. The problem is that without a clear definition, the owner may spend the redemption coin on other things. Therefore, one requires him to spell out where the coin will be taken and, since coins move around in a wallet, it is clear that he has to remove the coin from the wallet immediately and separate it.: “The Second Tithe in this container should be redeemed by the tetradrachma in that wallet, it is redeemed. Rebbi Yose says, it is not redeemed.” What is the reason of Rebbi Yose? “ 4:12: “If somebody says, the Second Tithe shall be redeemed by a tetradrachma that will come out of this wallet, or the denar that will come out of that wallet, R. Yose says, he did not redeem, but the Sages say, he did redeem. R. Yose agrees with the Sages that if he says that the Second Tithe shall be redeemed by the new tetradrachma which will come out of this wallet, or the new denar that will come out of that wallet, he did redeem. The Sages admit to Rebbi Yose that if he said [it shall be redeemed] by the tetradrachma that was in my son’s hand, the denar that was in my son’s hand, it is not redeemed since perhaps it was not in his hand at that time.” We have to assume that R. Yose agrees only in case the owner had only one new coin of that type at the moment of the declaration. If he said, the old tetradrachma or the old denar, he did redeem. The Sages admit to Rebbi Yose that if he said, the tetradrachma I shall take from my son’s hand, or the denar I shall take from my son’s hand, it is not redeemed since it was not in his hand at that time.” There, we have stated 3:8: “If somebody puts aside produce to serve for heave or tithes, or coins to serve for Second Tithe, he refers to them {to redeem produce or to put produce in order with the intention that all sanctity should devolve on produce and coins set aside} based on the prior knowledge that they still exist. If they are lost, he worries for 24 hours, the words of R. Eleazar (ben Shamua‘.)” In both the Babli ( 31a/b) and the Yerushalmi ( 3:8), there is a discussion whether the tithing is questionable for the 24 hours preceding the discovery of the loss or whether the tithing is not questionable only for the first 24 hours after produce or coins were set aside. In any case, there is no opposition noted by either R. Yose or R. Simeon. Since transporting wine from Samaria presumably takes less than 24 hours, such opposition would have been expected.: “If somebody puts aside produce … to serve for Second Tithe.” Does. Therefore, our is referred to as “there”, and the Mishnah as “here.” that Mishnah disagree with Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Simeon? Rebbi Zeïra said, there they become spoiled retroactively, but here they become spoiled only starting from the moment of loss again.. There, we have stated 6:6: “If a of Temple property fell into somebody’s wallet, or if somebody said, a in this wallet shall be Temple property, then the moment he spent the first coin he committed larceny, the words of Rebbi Aqiba. But the Sages say, not until he spent the entire wallet. Rebbi Aqiba agrees that if he said, ‘a from this wallet shall be Temple property,’ he may go and spend the entire contents of the wallet.” מעל refers to the particular case of larceny involving Temple property, whose private use is forbidden even if it does not impair its value (. 5:15). Our text is a that combines the Mishnah with Tosephta 3:1: “If a of Temple property fell into somebody’s wallet, or if somebody said, a in this wallet shall be Temple property, then the moment he spent the first coin he must bring an sacrifice for a possible sin, for the second coin an sacrifice for a certain sin, the words of Rebbi Aqiba. But the Sages say, an sacrifice for a possible sin is brought only for an offense which if deliberate is punished by being cut off (כרת, cf. J. Milgrom, Leviticus 1–16, New York 1991, pp. 457–460) or, if in error, must be atoned for by a sin-offering.”: “If a of Temple property fell into somebody’s wallet, or if somebody said, a in this wallet shall be Temple property,” it was stated that “with the first coin he committed probable larceny, with the second one certain larceny, the words of Rebbi Aqiba. But the Sages say, with any of them he committed probable larceny, except that with the last one he committed certain larceny.” Rebbi Yudan, the father of Rebbi Mattania said, that is, if there were ten coins. But if there were only two, with the first coin he committed probable larceny, with the second one certain larceny. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish asked before Rebbi Joḥanan: What is the difference between him who says “in the wallet” and him who says “from the wallet?” Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, even if he spent the entire wallet he would not have committed larceny; just as you say ‘that he drank retroactively,’ here also ‘retroactively he spent profane money.’ But here it depends on the act of separation can be removed only by an actual declaration fixing place and modality of heave and tithes.. Rebbi Jonah said, in both cases it depends on the act of separation; it is as if he said, this wallet should not be freed from a of Temple property 34a), this answer is given by R. Joḥanan. But the thrust of the Babli is about retroactive clarification that is excluded here and in the entire discussion of the Yerushalmi, as recognized by .. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish’s argument is inverted. There 13b, in explanation of Mishnah 3:7: “From water {drawn from the water canal flowing through the Temple courtyard on Friday afternoon of the festival of Tabernacles, to be used next morning for the water libation} in the golden barrel {that was not a sanctified vessel and in which the water would not become forbidden by standing in a vessel overnight} one may not have any use, but use is no larceny. Once it is poured into the pitcher {the holy vessel in which the water was transported to the altar} its use becomes larceny.” R. Simeon ben Laqish holds that there is no larceny from the water of the golden barrel if one uses the excess over the three that are to be filled into the holy pitcher. The interpretation of the Yerushalmi seems to be that if the barrel contained and somebody drew , even if &gt; 3 one would commit larceny in the amount of the cost of 3y/x of water., he says that one commits larceny with a corresponding to the computation of three . And here, he says so? After he asked, he returned and gave the simple answer. Rebbi Isaac ben Eleazar 18:1. said, a person can say on Friday, this shall be heave tomorrow, but nobody can say on the Sabbath, this shall be heave tomorrow. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, nobody can say on Friday, this shall be heave tomorrow. A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun 4:4. The exact text of the Mishnah reads: “If a vessel which was immersed that day {and will be pure only after sundown} was filled from an amphora with tithe, if he said that its contents should be heave of the tithe after nightfall, then this is heave of the tithe. If he said that it should be , he did not say anything.” Tithe can be only if the heave of the tithe was not taken; hence, ‘heave’ in our text should always mean ‘heave of the tithe’ as in the Mishnah.: “If a vessel,,,, -, . “large earthen vessel with neck and handles; flask, bottle”; same as Greek λάγηνος, perhaps identical with Κνίδιον, τὸ, “a measure of wine.” was immersed that day and somebody filled it from an amphora with tithe, if he said, its contents should be heave of the tithe tomorrow, i. e., after nightfall, then this is heave. If he said, that should be , Chapter 7, Note 56. The must be deposited on Friday afternoon and be at the right spot at sundown, so that he can acquire the Sabbath rest at that spot. But in our case, at sundown the wine is still ; since it may not be eaten it is not food, and the is invalid., he did not say anything.” Explain it if he transgressed. But Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: “He says in which R. Ḥiyya presents the text of the declaration to be recited in the case considered by R. Isaac ben Eleazar. R. Ḥiyya unconditionally permits the declaration.,” and you say, if he transgressed? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun retracted that.",

HALAKHAH: 8: We have stated for this 8:15–16 has a similar wording but cannot possibly be the basis of the quote here and either represents a different tradition from that of the Yerushalmi or is hopelessly corrupt. The latter is likely since the second part of 8:16, discussed here in Halakhah 7, is corrupt, as noted by all commentators from R. M. Margalit to R. S. Lieberman. The relevant part of the Tosephta reads: “If he had before him two baskets of , in each one a hundred, of which heave was taken. ‘The tithes of one are in the other one,’ the first one is tithed. ‘The tithes of one are in the other, and those of the other in the one’ the first one is not tithed. He takes two figs and two tenths and a tenth of a tenth. ‘Their tithes are tithes of each basket in the other one,’ he gave it a name.”: “He takes from the second one two figs and two tenths and a tenth of a tenth.” Samuel says, you cannot state that; when he takes one in ten he has to take one in a hundred, when he takes one in a hundred he has to take one in a thousand, when he takes one in a thousand he has to take one in ten thousand. Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina said, for the first basket he transgresses a commandment, for the second a commandment and a prohibition. For the first basket he transgresses a commandment since he gave both names simultaneously 3:7 states that the First Tithe is called “beginning” since it contains heave of the tithe, but the Second Tithe is never called “beginning.” Hence, the beginning should precede the non-beginning., and for the second a commandment and a prohibition since he gave both names simultaneously and he put the Second Tithe of the first basket before the First Tithe of the second basket4a/b, both R. Yose bar Ḥanina and R. Eleazar agree that declaring the Second Tithe before the First is a violation. R. Yose bar Ḥanina holds that transgressing a prohibition by words alone is not punishable in criminal law while R. Eleazar declares it punishable.. Rebbi Eleazar said, this is from Rebbi Meïr since Rebbi Meïr says that you accept only the very first version. There, we have stated 5:4: “This one {animal} shall be a substitute for a burnt offering {another animal already dedicated} and a substitute for an offering of well-being, then it is a substitution for a burnt offering, the words of Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Yose said, if this was his original intention then his words stand since it is impossible to pronounce two names at the same time. But if he changed his mind after he said, this one shall be a substitute for a burnt offering, and said, this one should be a substitute for an offering of well-being, then it is a substitute for a burnt offering.” Our Mishnah cannot be R. Yose’s since he would accept both the first and second versions if the original intention was the same. In the Babli, 25b/26a, the difference between R. Meïr and R. Yose is reduced to the stylistic nicety whether there is a difference in meaning between “a substitute for a burnt offering and a substitute for a peace offering” and “a substitute for a burnt offering and an offering of well-being.” It is difficult to square that approach with that of the Yerushalmi.: “This one shall be a substitute 27:9–10), nevertheless once done it is a valid dedication. for a burnt offering and for an offering of well-being, then it is a substitute for a burnt offering, the words of Rebbi Meïr.” Rebbi Yose 3:5) there are three opinions, that of R. Meïr (who takes only the first statement) and R. Yose (the Tanna, who asks to investigate what was in the mind of the speaker) as in the Mishnah, and that of the Sages who say that the animal should be put out to graze until it develops a bodily defect (and no longer could become a sacrifice) when it should be sold and the money received be split 50-50 to buy burnt and well-being offerings. said, we were of the opinion that Rebbi Meïr and the Sages disagree only after the time for speech 2:1, fol. 4b (Notes 50–51)., but not within the time for speech. Since Rebbi Eleazar said, the Mishnah is Rebbi Meïr’s, it means that even within the time of speech he cannot retract. This is the Mishnah: “Their tithes are tithes for each basket in the other one, he gave it a name,” because he declared both names at the same time. One after the other you accept only the very first version. Rebbi Abuna said, the Sages agree with Rebbi Meïr about him who says “this heave substitutes for Second” (that he is guilty). “This animal instead of well-being offerings,” he is obligated for two since he declared two names, Chapter 3, Note 78. at the same time; hence, one after the other you accept only the very first version. Not so, said Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac who said in the name of Rav Huna: “This one shall be a substitute for a burnt offering,” he may retract that within the time for speech. That is, if he wants to retract, there if he wants to add. If one said, “this is heave,” even within the time of speech he cannot retract. A person can be asked about his dedication but nobody can be asked about his heave. How does one act 8:16, in badly garbled form: “Their tithes are tithes of each basket in the other one, he gave it a name. One takes 20 figs from the one he chooses. In one 100, in one 200, if he takes from the small one, he takes 11, if from the large one, he takes it all and it is not enough. In one 100, in the other 1000, if he takes from the small one he takes 16, if he takes from the large one he takes all of 60. In other cases, by this computation.” In the computation, the second number in either case was switched.? “One takes 20 figs from any basket one chooses.” And in any 10 one takes there is one of heave of the tithe only heave of the tithe has to be given away; the Second Tithe is redeemed by a coin. In the current , only First Tithe is considered.. That is, if they were equal. “If in one basket there were 100 and in the other 200, if he takes for the one with a hundred, he takes 11. If for the one with 200 he takes 30. “If in one basket there were 100 and in the other 1000, if he takes for the one with a hundred, he takes 15. If for the one with a thousand, even if he takes the entire basket he does not complete taking.” “ 8:17. In all these cases, it is supposed that heave was already taken and only tithe with its heave has to be taken. If someone has a basket and wants to tithe it, he takes two ninths and a ninth of a ninth, corresponding to ten tithe and nine Second Tithe.” Why does he not say 19? Rebbi Zeïra said, the words of the Sages and their riddles. He who wants to bring a hundred figs in order into his house takes for ever single fig two ninths and a ninth of a ninth, 23 figs in all, four called ninth of a ninth.",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: A hundred in a hundred profane, he removes 101 3:9, where it is stated that if tithed and untithed produce are mixed together, it is preferable to tithe the untithed part from other produce, but if that proves impossible the whole turns into titheable produce as far as heaves are concerned, but not for other tithes. Since we are dealing with , it is always assumed that the first heave was taken and the only problem is heave of the tithe. Hence, in our case, one has to remove the 100 as equivalent of the to be tithed, and, since the profane returns to the status of untithed as far as heave of the tithe is concerned, another 1% for heave of the tithe.. A hundred in a hundred tithe, he removes 101. A hundred profane fully in order and a hundred tithe, he removes 110, and “profane fully in order” is produce of which it is known that both tithes were actually removed according to the rules of certain produce.. A hundred and ninety tithe, ninety and eighty tithe, he did not lose anything. That is the rule: Anytime that is more, he did not lose anything, an application of that rule would make the tithe forever .. HALAKHAH: : Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, one has to specify a stipulation and say: If is in my hands, it shall be tithe, but if tithe is in my hands, it shall be heave of the tithe and tithe were mixed together and one takes 101 parts for the of which the one part in excess is to be addititional heave of the tithe. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish states that heave can only be taken if it is specified from where it is to be taken. In our case, heave of the tithe can only be taken if the produce was first designated to be tithe. Hence, it is necessary to stipulate that it should be designated tithe if part of the grain originated from what was . Rebbi Jonah said, one has to add the converse stipulation and say, otherwise I did not do anything32:29–30) in which it was spelled out first what would happen if the conditions were met and second what would happen if they were not, any stipulation in Jewish law is valid only if it is formulated both in the positive and the negative sense. So R. Jonah simply means that the stipulation has to be legally valid.. Rebbi Joḥanan said, one does not have to add the converse stipulation. Either one of them follows his own opinion, since they disagreed, Chap. 3. The obligation of heave starts when grain, after threshing, is formed into heaps or put into a silo. If somebody has two heaps and he says, the heave of both heaps should be in one of them, without specifying in which one, then R. Joḥanan is of the opinion that both heaps are potentially profane mixed with heave, and both of them fall under the strict rules of ‘ until heave is taken. But R. Simeon ben Laqish holds that heave can only be taken from a designated spot; hence, the declaration is invalid and nothing has changed. It follows that, in our case, R. Simeon ben Laqish must require a declaration which fixes the exact part from which heave of the tithe may be taken, but R. Joḥanan holds that any produce that is potentially heave may be turned into heave by simple declaration.: Two heaps of grain, in one of them. Rebbi Joḥanan said, they are both forbidden as , but Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, they are not forbidden. Rebbi Mana said, they differ with Rebbi Eleazar ben Arakh in which he is mentioned.. As he stated 5:15: “ mixed with profane produce makes it forbidden even in the tiniest amounts. If it can be provided from another place, one takes it out in proportion. Otherwise, Rebbi Eliezer and Rebbi Eleazar ben Arakh say, he gives a name to the heave of the tithe and takes it out by 101; the same holds if it falls into tithe.” The in the Yerushalmi expresses the same but from another source. The assertion in the Tosephta that one always tithes in proportion contradicts the Mishnah since no penalty is incurred in form of heave of the tithe of the profane produce, as in the Mishnah.: “ mixed with profane produce, if it can be provided from another place, one takes it out in proportion. Otherwise, Rebbi Eleazar ben Arakh says, he gives a name to the heave of the tithe and takes it out by 101.” Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said, explain it with kinds one cannot take out 3:7; they are always sold by the piece and cannot become absorbed by anything into which they fall. Hence, no substitute can be taken out from any other produce and R. Eleazar ben Arakh himself precribes for them the remedy explained in the Mishnah.. Rebbi Hillel ben Pazi asked: Why can he not crack them? Rebbi Jonah said, is one permitted to crack them 3:8: If the nuts were cracked, or the pomegranates split,…, they may be taken out (like any other produce.)” In reference to tithes, the same is stated in Tosephta 5:10.? Did we not state: “If the nuts were cracked,” in the past. That means, not to start out with. Rebbi Jonah said, so is the Mishnah: Anytime that is more than the tithe, tithe does not lose anything exceeds the tithe by at least 10, one does not lose anything.” Maimonides and R. Abraham ben David clearly read the Yerushalmi as given in the text.. Rebbi Levinti in the name of Rebbi Jonah: Any mentioned here is for first and second tithes mentioned in the entire chapter refers to produce of which heave was taken and the question is only about tithes and heave of the tithe.. Rebbi Abbahu said, Rebbi and Rebbi Dositheos the son of Rebbi Yannai 4:15. disagree. One says, he takes the second tithe from another place, but the other one says, he makes all of it second tithe and takes the first tithe from another place quoted in the following sentences, in which the Tanna disagrees with the Tanna of the Mishnah and applies the rule of Mishnah 9 also to our case. If tithe returns to the state of untithed, then Second Tithe also is due, but it cannot be taken out here without disturbing the entire computation. Hence, it must be taken, and then redeemed, from other sources.. What are we talking about? “A hundred and ninety tithe, he takes 92 minus one tenth From this, he can legally only take 9 for heave of the tithe. But he has to take in all 10.9 by the rules of the previous Mishnah which the Tanna here also follows in case tithe is less than Hence, he has to take another 2-0.1 and then give 10.9 as heave of the tithe. If is 100 and tithe 80, he has to take 8 + 2.8 as heave of the tithe in order to put tithe and in order. In general, for 100 and tithe, he takes (1000 - 9n)/100. (Explanation by R. Z. Frankel, the only rational explanation of this paragraph.). A hundred and eighty tithe, he takes 83 minus two tenths. 5:17–18, which certainly is garbled but might in addition represent a Babylonian tradition opposed to that of the Yerushalmi: “100 tithe and 80 , he takes 91.9. 100 tithe and 90 , he takes 92.8. Other quantities proportionally.” Other quantities proportionally.”",

    "text_en": "MISHNAH: If somebody had ten rows of ten wine jugs 27a, notes that the Mishnah starts with “jugs” and continues with “amphoras,” to indicate that Biblical כד corresponds to rabbinic חבית. each, and he said that one from an outer row was tithe but he does no longer know which one, he takes two diagonally opposite amphoras= 1, 2,…,10 and the amphoras in each row by 1, 2,…,10. Then the position of each amphora is uniquely described by a couple (,) and the amphoras are filling a square. Also, let * denote any number from 1 to 10. The outer rows are (1,*), (10,*), (*,1), (*,10). Since the problem is not the tithe but the heave of the tithe, if one takes both amphoras (1,1) and (10,10) [or (1,10) and (10,1)] he will have taken one amphora from each boundary row and have valid heave of the tithe. From the last sentence of the Mishnah it becomes clear that in all cases, only one amphora has to be given as heave of the tithe. Hence, the interpretation here is that one takes half of each amphora chosen and pours into a new one, so that the full new amphora will be the heave of the tithe.. One of half an outer row was tithe but he does no longer know which one, then he takes the four amphoras at the four corners. One row was tithe but he does no longer know which one, then he takes one diagonal row,) for = 1,…, 10 or (10-+1,) for = 1,…, 10 then he will have taken one amphora from each row counted in either direction. Here, he takes one tenth out of each amphora chosen.. Half a row was tithe but he does no longer know which one, then he takes from the two diagonal rows, and (10-+1,) for = 1,…, 10. Then one amphora for each half-row starting at the border will have been taken. Here, one takes one twentieth of each amphora chosen.. One amphora was tithe but he does no longer know which one, then he takes from each amphora. HALAKHAH: Why does he not take two, and the method proposed is impossible. (Explanation of R. Eliahu Fulda.)? Rebbi Cohen in the name of the rabbis of Caesarea: When he separated half of the heave from another place. It was stated 5:22–23, which first explains how to take two pitchers and the declarations to make, as in the here. But then there is no disagreement reported but it is stated that the Cohen who drinks must immerse himself not only before drinking but between the drinks and after them, combining the rules of Rebbi and R. Eleazar ben R. Simeon. That Tosephta explains the practical rule and not the background as does the here. Nevertheless, the text of the Tosephta cannot stand as it is in manuscript and print: “The pitchers, one of impure tithe, the other of pure tithe. He drinks from one and immerses himself, and drinks from the other and immerses himself, and drinks from both of them together, and needs an immersion at the end.” All commentators of the Tosephta feel compelled to rearrange the Tosephta according to the Yerushalmi.: “If there were two amphoras before him, one of pure tithe which was and one of impure tithe which was , he brings two vessels and takes from each of them heave of the tithe for both of them. He then turns and lifts one vessel and says: If this one is pure, I am making it heave of the tithe; else I did not do anything. Then he turns, does the same for the second vessel, immerses himself and drinks, the words of Rebbi. Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar says, he takes it only at the end.” What is the reason of Rebbi? I say, maybe he started drinking the impure one first. And what is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon? Maybe he drank the impure one at the end. Everybody agrees that he who drinks impure liquids may not even eat heave that is in doubt, about 135 cm) then, by rabbinic decree ( 5:12), his body becomes impure even if the impurity was only secondary. (Biblical impurity is transferred to a person only by original impurity.) If the impurity is certain, then by rabbinic decree he is impure even if it is in doubt whether the food is heave or not. But if the drink is only suspected of being impure there is no rabbinic decree and impurity is imparted only by original impurity. The discussion here assumes that all impurities discussed are rabbinic in character.. If the liquids were possibly impure, everybody agrees that he may eat what certainly is heave. But here we deal with another Mishnah 5:12.. What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon? Since according to both the impurity is certain, he needs immersion. What is the reason of Rebbi? That he should not be led into drinking a of a questionable liquid.. According to the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon, he drinks less than a , the other about one who drinks more.. Is Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon not afraid that he would be led into drinking a ? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, the only explanation you have is our first one. Rebbi is afraid that he drank the impure liquid first and Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon is afraid that he drank the impure liquid at the end.",
