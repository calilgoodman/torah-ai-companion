    "text_en": "Nowadays1e., after the dissolution of the Jewish Commonwealth. Derived from Git. 88b; B.K. 84b; San. 2b-3a, according to which non-Mumḥin (v. infra. n. 13) may adjudicate cases of admissions and transaction of loans which are matters of frequent occurrence and involve a monetary loss, thereby carrying out the commission of the Sanhedrin of the Land of Israel. The present ruling applies today to the Land of Israel too. Cf. Git. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. במלתא. Thus also Asheri and Tur. The underlying reason for this law is given by the Codifiers as follows: ‘Judges and officers thou shalt make thee in all thy gates which the Lord thy G-d giveth thee tribe by tribe (Deut. XVI, 18. This has reference to the Land of Israel only) — (this means that) in your gates (i.e., in Israel) tribunals should be set up in every district as well as in every city. However, outside the Land (of Israel) you should set up tribunals in every district but not in every city’ (Mak. 7a). This, of course, applied only to those times when the original form of ‘ordination’ (Semikah, סמיכה) was in vogue, but nowadays all judges have no authoritative power to adjudicate legal questions Biblically, as it is written, — ‘And these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them (Ex. XXI, 1) — before them (i.e., authoritative judges, specially ordained) and not before non-Mumḥin (laymen judges)’ — Git. ibid. Consequently, today we merely act as agents of the former authoritative judges and deal only with matters of frequent occurrence which also involve a monetary loss (Tur) — M.E. On the question whether we carry out today the commission of the former duly ordained judges Rabbinically or Biblically, there is a difference of opinion among the Codifiers. N and RaShBA hold that our commission is Rabbinical. Nethiboth maintains that it is Biblical. the Judges may adjudicate cases of admissions2Heb. הודאות admissions. This refers to proceedings resting on evidence of witnesses attesting to the defendant’s admission of his indebtedness. הלוואות transaction of loans has reference to evidence offered by witnesses who were present at the time of the transaction of the loan. Today the judges may also deal with cases where there are no witnesses, e.g., where one has to take a consuetudinal or equitable oath (שבועת היסת i.e., if one who is sued for a debt denies the latter entirely (כופר הכל) in contradistinction to the legal or Biblical oath which is required when the defendant admits a part of the claim (מודה במקצת), it being presumed that nobody will go to law unless he have a claim. Consequently, it is a matter of equity to put the opponent to an oath, to which he may in turn put the claimant — M.E. and transaction of loans,2Heb. הודאות admissions. This refers to proceedings resting on evidence of witnesses attesting to the defendant’s admission of his indebtedness. הלוואות transaction of loans has reference to evidence offered by witnesses who were present at the time of the transaction of the loan. Today the judges may also deal with cases where there are no witnesses, e.g., where one has to take a consuetudinal or equitable oath (שבועת היסת i.e., if one who is sued for a debt denies the latter entirely (כופר הכל) in contradistinction to the legal or Biblical oath which is required when the defendant admits a part of the claim (מודה במקצת), it being presumed that nobody will go to law unless he have a claim. Consequently, it is a matter of equity to put the opponent to an oath, to which he may in turn put the claimant — M.E. marriage contracts,3Containing among other things, the settlement of a certain amount due to the wife on her husband’s death or on being divorced. Heb. Kethubah (כתובה), — the wife’s settlement. inheritances,4Thus Asheri and Tur derived from San. 3a, Tosaf. s.v. שלא. gifts4Thus Asheri and Tur derived from San. 3a, Tosaf. s.v. שלא. and damage done to another person's chattel,5Yad, Sanhedrin V, 9 derived from B.K. ibid. which are matters that are of frequent occurrence and involve a monetary loss;6In the case of ‘inheritances’ and ‘gifts’ which are of frequent occurrence there is also the possibility of a loss involved, for no doubt the claimant must have rendered some service to the bequeather or the donor (Thus A.H.). The underlying reason in the case of admissions and the transaction of loans is ‘in order not to shut the door against borrowers’ (שלא תנעול דלת בפני לווין). For a creditor will refuse to grant a loan should he find it difficult to collect his debt. The same reason applies to the other matters enumerated here. This (viz., that we deal only with matters of frequent occurrence which involve a monetary loss) has reference only to monetary claims. But in the case of other important matters, such as, accepting converts, although it is of infrequent occurrence, or in the case of compelling an obstinate husband to grant his wife a divorce although it does not involve a monetary loss, the law is that we may deal with such cases — M.E. but matters that are not of frequent occurrence although they involve a monetary loss,7Yad ibid. e.g., cattle that injured other [cattle],8As a result of goring with the ‘horn’ (קרן) which is of infrequent occurrence. This, of course, refers not only to damage caused by ‘horn’ but also to all other types of injury or damage of infrequent occurrence (e.g., damage caused by ‘fire’ and ‘pit’ (אש זבור) — Shak.  Mishna B.K. I,  P.Tesh., however, cites authorities who permit a Jewish Court today to deal in matters pertaining to damage caused by ‘fire’ and ‘pit’). This form of damage is called חבלה. Hence, the term שחבלה used here. In the case of damage or injury which is of frequent occurrence and involves a monetary loss, the legal term used is היזק.  infra par. 3 — M.E. or matters that do not involve a monetary loss although they are of frequent occurrence,7Yad ibid. e.g., the repayment of the double amount,9e., the additional amount to be paid as fine on restoring stolen goods (Ex. XXII, 3; 6-8). This is derived from San. 8a where it is stated that cases of fine must be dealt with by three authoritative Judges (Mumḥin), but not laymen Judges. The repayment of the double amount (תשלומי כפל), it may be asked, in any case belongs to the category of fines (קנסות) mentioned anon, and the payment thereof is collected only by authoritative judges (Mumḥin)? Furthermore, Tur has בושת i.e., payment for indignity suffered which is of frequent occurrence although there is no monetary loss involved. Likewise, in the foregoing example of matters of infrequent occurrence although there is no monetary loss involved, Tur has ‘e.g., if a man injured another man’ instead of Caro’s example (following Maim. in Yad ibid.) ‘cattle that injured other cattle’. The difficulty may be removed if we understand our text as follows: First Caro states examples (e.g., the repayment of the double amount and cattle that injured other cattle) which are specifically of a penal nature (קנס) and then the general proviso, ‘and likewise all fines’ which the Rabbis equated to these examples. Consequently, the examples cited by Tur are included in the general statement concerning fines — M.E. and likewise, all fines that were imposed by the Sages,10B.K. ibid. dealing with a case where R. Ḥisda consulted R. Naḥman and the latter replied, ‘Ḥisda, Ḥisda, are you really prepared to order the collection of fines in Babylon?’ Cf. also B.K. 27b. For the right to collect fines was confined only to the Judges of the land of Israel. as [in the case of] one who boxes his neighbour's [ear] — The meaning [of Toke'a should be understood as] 'He shouts in a [loud] voice into his [neighbour's] ear and frightens him10B.K. ibid. dealing with a case where R. Ḥisda consulted R. Naḥman and the latter replied, ‘Ḥisda, Ḥisda, are you really prepared to order the collection of fines in Babylon?’ Cf. also B.K. 27b. For the right to collect fines was confined only to the Judges of the land of Israel. — or as [in the case of] one who slaps his neighbour — e., He strikes [him] with his hand on the cheek11, Mishna B.K. VIII, 6(90a). Cf. infra § 420, 4 Caro adopts Maim. (Yad ibid.) explanation of תוקע; Isserless accepts the explanation of Rashi and RaN (v. B.K. 90a and Kid. 11b, Rashi s.v. התוקע and cf. RaN ibid.). , B.K. 84b, Rashi s.v. ופגם whence it is implied that if the amount is not definitive it is not regarded as a fine. Yet, since it is of infrequent occurrence and does not involve a monetary loss, we cannot order its collection. The Rabbis, however, called it קנס (fine) because the law thereof is similar to fines. Cf. B.K. 27b, 84b, Tosaf, s.v. קנסא — M.E. — and thus also whosoever pays more than the actual damage done, or one who pays half-damages,12B.K. 15b, 27b; Ket. 41b and v. Tur. E.g., the repayment of the double amount (Ex. XXII, 3) or the four or five-fold restitution of stolen goods (Ex. XXI, 37), or on restoring misappropriated property, one fifth of the principal had to be added as a fine (Lev. V, 16, 24; XXVII, 27), or half-damages done by an innocuous animal (תם), i.e., an animal that did not gore three times and did injury before warning had been given, opp. מועד (Ex. XXI, 28-36; B.K. I, 4; II, 4). Cf. infra § 390 and v. Yad ibid. — [the law is that] only authoritative Judges13Heb. מומחים i.e., experienced scholars versed in matters of law who alone are referred to by the Scriptural term Elohim meaning ‘Judges’ as in Ex. XXI, 6; XXII, 7-8. , San. 2b; infra § 3, 2. Cf. supra n.  duly ordained14San. 14a. On the question of ‘Ordination’ (סמיכה), v. Yad, Sanhedrin IV and cf. Y.D. § 242; supra n. 1; J.P. Y.D. § 335-403, Int. XI-XI in the Land of Israel may judge it15e., such a case. save [in the case of the liability for] half-damages [done by] pebbles,16Kicked by an animal. This is a derivative of ‘foot.’ , B.K. 17a. which is [regarded as] civil and not [as] penal.17B.K. 15b; Ket. 41b. In addition to the matters mentioned supra, Semikah (Ordination) nowadays is also valid for dealing in matters pertaining to Ḥalizah and Divorce — ShaK.",

    "text_en": "[In the case of] a man who injured his fellow-man — [the law is that] Judges who are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel18, supra par. 1, n. 1. cannot order the payment for injury,19Tur citing Yad, Sanhedrin V, 10. Derived from Mishna B.K. VIII, 1 and Gemara ibid. 84a-b where it is stated that the liability for injury (נזק) is determined by regarding the injured person as if he were a slave sold in the market place and an assessment is made as to how much he was worth before the injury was inflicted and how much he is worth now. Although there is a monetary loss involved, yet since this is of infrequent occurrence, Judges nowadays cannot order the payment thereof (v. par. 1). Much more so in the case of pain (צער) and indignity (בושת) where no monetary loss is involved that payment cannot be ordered by present day Judges. pain,19Tur citing Yad, Sanhedrin V, 10. Derived from Mishna B.K. VIII, 1 and Gemara ibid. 84a-b where it is stated that the liability for injury (נזק) is determined by regarding the injured person as if he were a slave sold in the market place and an assessment is made as to how much he was worth before the injury was inflicted and how much he is worth now. Although there is a monetary loss involved, yet since this is of infrequent occurrence, Judges nowadays cannot order the payment thereof (v. par. 1). Much more so in the case of pain (צער) and indignity (בושת) where no monetary loss is involved that payment cannot be ordered by present day Judges. blemish,20Yad ibid. and Tur a.l. do not include blemish (פגם). TaZ states that M’s version of the of the Talmud (B.K. 84b) did not have ‘blemish.’ MS.M. also omits ‘blemish’ although found in cur. edd. Liability for blemish applies only in the case of rape (v. E.H. § 177). Blemish stands on an equal footing as injury (v. B.K. ibid., Rashi s.v. ופגם). It may, however, be asked, why blemish (פגם) which is of frequent occurrence and involves a monetary loss (B.K. ibid.) should not be adjudicated today? This difficulty may be removed if we realize that ‘frequent occurrence’ of blemish applies only to the assessment, i.e., we know how to determine the liability of blemish (the difference in valuation between a virgin בתולה and a non-virgin בעולה), but the actual act of rape is of infrequent occurrence — M.E. indignity,19Tur citing Yad, Sanhedrin V, 10. Derived from Mishna B.K. VIII, 1 and Gemara ibid. 84a-b where it is stated that the liability for injury (נזק) is determined by regarding the injured person as if he were a slave sold in the market place and an assessment is made as to how much he was worth before the injury was inflicted and how much he is worth now. Although there is a monetary loss involved, yet since this is of infrequent occurrence, Judges nowadays cannot order the payment thereof (v. par. 1). Much more so in the case of pain (צער) and indignity (בושת) where no monetary loss is involved that payment cannot be ordered by present day Judges. and indemnity,21Lit. ‘ransom price.’ This is omitted by Yad ibid and Tur a.l., for “indemnity’ refers only to a case where an animal killed a person but has no reference to a general case of ‘injury.’ Caro for the sake of brevity states here blemish (פגם) and indemnity (כופר) along with the other items although the former belong to a different category of injury, but since all these items are similar in that they are not adjudicated by present day Judges they are mentioned together — M.E. but they may order the payment for loss of time and healing.22Yad ibid., derived from Raba’s dictum in B.K. 84a, ‘Payment for which the injured person would have to be valued as if he were a slave is not collected in Babylon,’ which is explained (thus Kes. Mish.; B.Yos.; MaHaRIK Rt. 1 a.o.) as referring to ‘injury’ (נזק) only, which, it is true, involves a monetary loss, but is of infrequent occurrence (v. supra n. 19). Hence, Raba’s dictum does not include ‘loss of time’ and ‘healing.’ Consequently, payment may be ordered by a Jewish Court today for the latter. Thus also Isserlein in his Decisions (פסקים) — that nowadays we may order payment for ‘healing’ and ‘loss of time’ and likewise impose a fine upon the offender. Asheri and Alfasi, however, hold that payment for the latter are not ordered today. Raba’s dictum is explained by them to refer to anything that requires valuation (כל הנישום). Caro, however, accepts the opinion of Maim. since it is supported by the Geoninm (Yad ibid.). Thus also Hag. Asheri to B.K. ibid. Gloss: And some say that also [cases of] healing and loss of time they23Present day Judges. do not adjudicate.24Tur on the authority of Asheri — G. , supra n. 22 and San. 2a Rashi s.v. וחבלות. However, I have not seen [them] adopt [this] practice, [viz.,] to be strict in this [matter]25But contra Caro, payment for ‘healing’ and ‘loss of time’ is not ordered today. save that they coerce the injurer26In D.M., Isserles adds ‘to heal him and etc.,’ i.e., in order to appease the injured person. For were we not to compel him to appease the injured person, an individual would feel free to injure his fellow-man and be exempt. , infra par. 5 and notes. to appease the injured [with money] and to penalize him according to that which appears [reasonable] to them27D.M. in accord with Isserles’ opinion to the Decisions (of Isserlein) s. 208 — G. as will be explained anon par. 5.",

    "text_en": "[With respect to] cattle that injured man, — [the law is that] Judges who are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel28, supra par. 1, n. 1 may not collect payment for his injury because it is a matter that is not of frequent occurrence.29, B.K. 2b where it is stated that ‘man is cautious’ and Rashi explains that it is more difficult to injure a man than an animal since he possesses foresight. However, a man who caused damage to his fellow-man's cattle pays full damages everywhere.30Whether in or outside the Land of Israel. As in the case of one who tears his fellow-man’s garment or breaks his vessels or mutilates his shoots. Likewise, cattle that caused damage by means of Tooth and Foot, since [with respect to the latter] it is regarded as Mua'd ab initio, this is considered a matter of frequent occurrence, and Judges who are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel28, supra par. 1, n. 1 may order the payment thereof.31Yad, Sanhedrin V, 11-12. Derived from B.K. 84a-b in the case of the ox that chewed the hand of a child and Raba ruled, ‘Go forth and value the child as if it were a slave,’ and after a lengthy discussion in the Talmud (ibid.), Raba’s dictum, viz., that payment may be collected in Babylon where chattel was damaged by cattle, is explained to have reference to damage done by Tooth or Foot which is considered Mu‘ad ab initio. For Mu‘ad v. Glos. Thus also, [with respect to] one who stole or robbed32This refers to the unlawful acquisition of chattels by violence. Cf. Lev. V, 23; II Sam. XXIII, 21. [an object], they may collect from him the principal only.33Yad, Sanhedrin V, 1 , B.K. 84b where it is concluded that in matters of a penal nature we do not act as agents of the former authoritative Judges of Israel. Hence, only the principal may be collected. , also B.K. 115a where such cases were dealt with in Babylon and B.K. 96b in the case of the man who misappropriated a pair of oxen and B.K. 21a in the case of a certain person who built a villa on the ruins that belonged to orphans and when R. Naḥman advised the defendant to make a peaceful settlement with the orphans, he refused to do so, whereupon R. Naḥman confiscated the villa. Cf. also ibid. 37a and 4b. In the latter reference it is stated that theft (גניבה) and larceny (גזילה) involve civil liability. A difficulty, however, presents itself, viz., in the Mishna San. I, 1 and Gemara ibid. 3a we are told that cases of larceny are dealt with by Mumḥin Judges only, which contradicts the present ruling. Tosaf. (ibid. s.v. שלא; B.K. 84b s.v. אי נמי; Git. 88b s.v. אי הכי) explain that the Mishna ibid. refers to cases of larceny by means of injury inflicted (גזילות ע״י חבלות), in which case only Mumḥin Judges may adjudicate the matter. Hence, in such cases of larceny we nowadays cannot act as the agents of the former authoritative Judges, since this is a matter of infrequent occurrence, but cases of larceny where no bodily injury resulted we may act as the agents of the former. Thus also Kes. Mish. and B.Yos. N.Yos., however, removes the above difficulty as follows: Caro’s ruling that we may order the payment of the principal in cases of larceny refers only to matters of frequent occurrence, such as, one who denies a deposit (v. Gloss anon), but actual larceny is of infrequent occurrence. Hence, it is not adjudicated today (v. D.M. a.l.). ShaK advances a different opinion, viz., that in San. ibid. we deal with the adjudication of fines, e.g., the repayment of the double amount, the four and five-fold restitution, which require only Mumḥin Judges (v. supra par. 1 and notes), but the actual principal is recoverable even by laymen Judges (this is however, a stained interpretation, since the payment of the double etc., refers to cases of theft but not to larceny — Ba’er Heteb). ShaK also writes that the increment (שבח) of the misappropriated article prior to the owner’s resignation, is also recoverable today contra BaḤ. RaN and N offer an altogether different explanation in removing the above difficulty, viz., that as to San. ibid. that requires Mumḥin in cases of larceny, it has reference only to the period when such Judges were available, but if, as today, Mumḥin are no longer available, even laymen Judges may deal with such matters. Thus also Nethiboth, K.H. and Tummim. Otherwise, the earth will become full of violence — A.H. Gloss: And some say [that this applies] only to cases of larceny that are of frequent occurrence, e.g., [a guardian] who denies [having received] a deposit and the like, but actual larceny is not [considered] of frequent occurrence and they do not adjudicate [this] unless the robbed object is [still] intact, [in which case] they order [him] to return it.34N.Yos. to B.K. 84b — G. , previous note.",

    "text_en": "[With respect to] the laws of damage caused indirectly,35B.K. 98b; Ket. 86a where it is related that in the case of an action for damage caused indirectly, Rafram (in accord with R. Meir ibid. 100a) compelled R. Ashi, who in his childhood had destroyed by burning, the bond of a creditor, to make payment ‘like a beam fit for decorative mouldings,’ i.e., a proverbial expression for ‘straight and exact’ and out of the best of one’s estate (v. ibid. 5a), whence we see that payment for indirect damage (גרמי) may be collected even by laymen Judges outside the Land of Israel, and such payment is not regarded as a fine (קנס). , Yad Ḥobel u-Mazzik VII, 9. There are three expressions used in Talmudical terminology with reference to different categories of damage that require elucidation, viz., a) היזק שאינו ניכר — damage not discernible in the object itself, such as, leavened matter over which Passover has passed (which had been in the house during Passover) that becomes forbidden for use after Passover, although the damage is not evident here; b) דינא דגרמי — indirect damage which is discernible and is not the result of any action performed, such as, in the case of the fence of a vineyard that has been broken down and the owner of the adjoining cornfield requires the owner of the vineyard to restore it. If the owner of the vineyard neglects the matter and does not restore it, he thereby causes his neighbour’s produce to become forfeit (Deut. XXII, 9) and is held responsible for the loss; c) גרמא בנזקין — where the damage caused indirectly is not evident, e.g., when one places a ladder near his neighbour’s dovecote, thereby causing indirectly a marten to jump in, the law is that since there is also the possibility that the marten will not jump in, hence the one who placed the ladder is not held responsible — N.Yos. to B.K.  Cf. ‘Ar. Comp. II, p. 365 s.v. גרם and v. infra § 386 on further distinctions between גרמא and גרמי. Cf. also infra § 66, 32; B.B. 94a, RaShBaM s.v. נותן לו. and likewise, [regarding] the law of the informer,36B.K. 116b-117a records a number of cases regarding ‘informers’ which were adjudicated by the Amoraim in Babylon. , Yad, Gezelah wa-Abedah IX, 3. — Judges who are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel37 supra par. 1, n. 1. may adjudicate them.38One may be compelled nowadays to support his minor children since it is a religious duty and does not belong to the category of fines — K.H. Gloss: Witnesses who offered false evidence and were found Zomemim,39Zomemim, plur. of Zomem, from the rt. זמם ‘to plot’ or ‘to scheme.’ This refers to witnesses whose personal presence at the alleged offence is challenged by other witnesses. In other words, they are proven to have been ‘schemers’ or ‘plotters,’ and they are punished by the law of retaliation (Deut. XIX, 16ff.). According to W.G., Isserles mentions this ruling here, since as in the aforementioned law of the ‘informer’ damage is caused by mere speech without tangible action (this is also apparent in Mord. to B.K. VIII, the source of this ruling) contra M.E. who writes that Isserles states this here as an independent law. and they [the Judges] had [already] collected payment on [the strength of] their testimony,40This applies only if money had already been collected on their testimony, although the principle, as he had purposed to do (Deut. ibid.) and not as he had done (v. Ḥul. 11b, Rashi s.v. אין נהרגין and Torah Temimah ibid.) would imply that only if the money had not yet been collected from the person against whom they plotted is payment exacted from th Zomemim witnesses, but not if payment had been ordered and paid, — nevertheless, in civil liability (as in the present case) the above principle (which is of a penal nature) is not applicable (v. B.K. 4b, Tosaf. s.v. עדים). The reason why the example of הזמה (the refutation of the witnesses by another set of witnesses by proving an alibi, e.g., ‘How can you offer this testimony, if, at the time you state that the alleged offence was committed, you were present with us in another locality?’) is mentioned, and not the example of הכחשה (counter-evidence which contradicts the testimony of the first set of witnesses), is because in the latter case when two witnesses state that So-and-So borrowed money from So-and-So, as a result of which money was collected on their testimony, and subsequently, two other witnesses came and offered counterevidence, the former set of witnesses cannot be ordered to make payment, for we may say, that the evidence offered by the second set of witnesses does not carry more weight than that of the first set. Not so, however, if the witnesses are proven Zomemim (v. infra § 31, 38; § 46, 37) — M.E. , also infra § 28, 3, Gloss. However, if the testimony of the witnesses, who were subsequently proven Zomemim, merely exempted the defendant from taking an oath, thereby causing damage to the claimant, — for if the defendant would have had to take an oath (which, now it appears would have been a false oath), he would have made payment instead of swearing falsely, — nevertheless, the Zomemim witnesses are not required to make restitution, for this is not considered a case of דינא דגרמי (indirect damage which is discernible. , supra n. 35) but rather belongs to the category of גרמא בנזקין (indirect damage which is not evident. , ibid.) — P.Tesh. and it is impossible to recover [the payment now],41e., the claimant who received payment on the testimony of the witnesses who were proven Zommim, had already spent the money. — [the law is that] they judge them and order them to pay.42Mord. to B.K. VIII beg. — G. Thus also RaShaL ibid.  Infra § 29, par. 2.",

    "text_en": "Although [the law is] that Judges that are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel28, supra par. 1, n. 1 cannot order the payment of fines,43 supra par. 1 and notes [nevertheless], they may place him44The injurer. under the ban until he appeases his litigant [with money],45Yad, Sanhedrin V, 17 and Alfasi to B.K. VIII on the authority of the Yeshiboth presided over by the Geonim. Thus also Tur. The injurer is placed under the ban only in the case where he or his chattel caused injury, because the injured person does not receive more than the damage incurred, and should we not adopt this stringency one would feel that he is free to injure his fellow-man and be entirely exempt. This, however, does not have reference to cases which involve the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution — M.E., ShaK, RaShaL. ‘Ir Shushan writes that when the defendant is placed under the ban, which is lifted only after he appeases the plaintiff by compensating the latter for the damage, such compensation must include not only an approximate amount of the actual damages suffered but also of the payment of the double and the four and five-fold restitution. M.E. rejects this ruling because as stated above the injurer is placed under the ban only in the case where there is no additional payment of fines. and as soon as he44The injurer. gives him an amount which appears reasonable [to the injurer to be given] to him, they release him44The injurer. [from the ban],46This does not refer to an exact amount corresponding to the damage but rather to an approximate amount. Thus also Tur on the authority of R. Sherira Gaon, Asheri and Alfasi. This explains the words, ‘they release him (from the ban),’ i.e., although the injured person demands full payment. This also follows from the Gloss of Isserles, ‘whether his litigant was appeased etc.’ The following words, however, ‘if the injured person seized an amount etc.,’ refers to seizure of the full amount. The latter statement has reference to a seizure that also compensates the injured person with respect to the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution. Biblically, one who admits an act with which a fine is connected, is exempt from the fine (מודה בקנס פטור v. Ket. 43a). But the admission must be made in the presence of a Court duly ordained (v. supra par. 1, n. 1). Hence, nowadays the defendant’s admission would not exempt him from the additional fine also seized by the claimant, save that the following distinction should be borne in mind, viz., that if the defendant admitted that witnesses were present during the time that the damage was done, he is still held responsible and his admission does not exempt him, but if no witnesses were present at that time, the claimant’s seizure of the additional amount corresponding to the fine is not valid — Nethiboth. If the injurer died, we do not place his heir under the ban, for the main purpose of the Geonic enactment (v. supra n. 45) was that violent men should not be on the increase. Hence, the injurer only is placed under a ban but not his heir in the case of the former’s death — Nethiboth and Tummim. whether his litigant was appeased [thereby] or whether he was not appeased. And likewise, if the injured person seized an amount, [viz.,] whatever is proper for him to take, they do not reclaim [it] from him.47Conclusion reached in B.K. 15b; Ket. 41b. This ruling applies even if the plaintiff seized an amount corresponding to the fine as well, for the law is that had we been permitted to adjudicate this matter today, the defendant would have paid an amount corresponding to the actual damage plus the fine. Consequently, the plaintiff’s seizure is considered valid. So also Asheri and Tur (infra § 349 end). , also Isserles infra § 348, 4 Gloss. Caro and Isserles state the law here without making a distinction as to whether the seizure was made at the time the damage was suffered or subsequent to that, or whether the chattel that caused the damage was seized by the injured person or other possessions of the injurer. R. Tam in Tosaf. to B.K. and Ket. ibid. s.v. ואי תפס holds that the plaintiff seized the animal that caused the damage, i.e., before it reached the owner’s hand. Thus Hag. Maim. to Yad ibid. This is substantiated by Ket. 84b according to which R. Tarfon maintains that the seizure of a man’s produce by a creditor is valid after the latter’s death, provided, — as Rab and Samuel explain — it lies in a heap in a public domain, i.e., in a place where Meshikah is possible. In other words, before it passes into the hands of the heirs. , Hag. Derisha u-Perisha. But other chattels cannot be seized by him. For if so, the plaintiff will continue to seize thereafter other items too, and we would not be able to dispossess him thereof, since this comes under the category of ‘fines’ which are not adjudicated today. Asheri on the other hand, maintains, that even other chattels, not necessarily the animal that caused the damage, may be seized. Should he seize more than his damage we may dispossess him of the surplus which does not come under the category of ‘fines’ since the adjudication will be for the surplus seizure which is permissible to be dealt with by the Judges. , also RIDBaZ to Yad ibid. who writes that were R. Tam’s explanation correct, the text should have stated ואי תפסיה i.e., ‘he seized it’ and would be referring to the tort-feasant animal or the like (v. B.K. and Ket. ibid.). Furthermore, the law is that the nuisance, in this case the animal, must be abated, as R. Nathan said, ‘Whence is it derived that a man should not breed a bad dog in his house? — From the text, That thou bring not blood upon thy house (Deut. XXII, 8).’ Hence, we see that Caro and Isserles in stating the law here adopt the opinion of Asheri. Mord. writes that if the damage was caused through ‘Horn’ we follow R. Tam, and in other cases of damage (e.g., cattle that caused damage to man even through ‘Tooth’ and ‘Foot’ which are of infrequent occurrence. Thus K.H.) we adopt the opinion of Asheri. In the case of an ‘innocuous animal’ (Tam. , Glos.) that caused damage, some say that the seizure is valid only if the plaintiff seized the animal proper, for the owner of such an animal pays only half-damages and the payment is made out of the body of the tort-feasant animal (v. Mishna B.K. 34a) — Nethiboth. The seizure spoken of here refers to one made in accordance with Jewish Law but not if carried out through non-Jewish Law (RaShaL) — ShaK. R.A.Eger, however, writes that only ‘in the first instance’ (לכתחילה) is it forbidden to seize through a non-Jew, but if already done (דיעבד) the seizure is considered valid (thus implied in RaShaL, the source of this ruling. Cf. infra § 4 Gloss) — P.Tesh. If a guardian advances the plea of theft in the case of an article which was entrusted with him for safekeeping and took the ‘guardians’ oath’ (שבועת השומרים) after which it was discovered that he himself had stolen the deposited article, — the law is that if the plaintiff seized an amount including the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution, since nowadays one is not required to pay the latter, the reason being that the oath must be taken before a duly ordained Court comprised of Mumḥin, — the seizure is not valid — ShaK, Nethiboth. Gloss: And if the injured person should say,48To the Judges. 'Assess for me my damage so that I should know up to how much I should seize,' he is not obeyed,49For otherwise it would mean that we adjudicate penal cases. But whatever he is instructed to return to the injurer does not come under the category of penal matters, since he had already seized it himself. RaShaL rules in accord with Alfasi that with respect to anything which is of a civil and not of a penal nature save that it is of infrequent occurrence, we do obey him and assess the damage for him — ShaK. save that if he had already seized, they assess for him [his damage] and instruct him, 'So much you may keep [as your own] and so much you must return [to the injurer].'50Tur on the authority of Asheri to B.K. VIII and to B.K. I end — G. This is contra MaHaRIW who maintains that all that was seized by the claimant must be returned. Isserles, as can be seen, adopts the opinion of Asheri that only the surplus should be restored. Asheri and Tur also rule that if the plaintiff does not produce witnesses that he is entitled to the amount seized, he must return whatever he seized. Isserles, however, writes that this applies only if he seized in the presence of witnesses, but if the seizure was not in the presence of witnesses, and the defendant denies having incurred any damage, the claimant is believed on the principle of Miggo (a legal rule according to which a deponent’s statement is accepted as true on the ground that if he had intended to tell a lie, he might have invented one more advantageous to his case, viz., he might have said, ‘I did not seize at all’). , infra § 87, 30. This principle applies not only to claims of civil liability but also to those of a penal nature (Mord. to B.K. III; Tur infra § 399; Isserles and ‘Ir Shushan) — M.E. R. Mordekai ha-Lewi (cited by Tur ibid.) states that the principle of Miggo is not valid in penal cases. Thus also N.Yos. to B.K. III end; Mag. Mish. to Yad, Nizke Mamon IX end. In the case where the injurer died, the seizure of the orphans’ money or chattels is not valid in penal cases, for legally movable property of orhpans does not become mortgaged to a creditor save that the Geonim decreed that they become mortgaged. But this Geonic decree certainly does not apply to penal cases — Nethiboth, A.H. If the injured person seized an amount which also corresponds to the fine, after which the injurer reseized the fine, the Judges nowadays cannot order this fine to be returned to the injured person, for if so, it would mean that they adjudicate fines — Nethiboth. R.A.Eger, however, states that the amount corresponding to the fine may be restored to the injured person, for once the latter seized this amount it became his personal property and no longer falls under the category of fines — P.Tesh. And all this51That nowadays Judges have no authority to adjudicate fines. [applies] only to fines stated [in Biblical Law], but [as to] fines which the Sages come [from time to time] to impose of their own accord with respect to [one who does not observe] their ordinance[s],52e., ordinances decreed by the Sages for the sake of safe-guarding the Torah laws — A.H. they may collect everywhere30Whether in or outside the Land of Israel. As in the case of one who tears his fellow-man’s garment or breaks his vessels or mutilates his shoots. as will be explained in § 2.53Mord. to Git. IV end — G. Mord. also writes that although we do not order the payment of fines nowadays, we should however, adjudicate these matters in accord with the ‘seven representatives of the town’ (שבעה טובי העיר). , Meg. 27a. In the Decisions of Isserlein it is recorded that one who does not heed the decisions of the Court may be penalized — M.E.",

    "text_en": "Every Court of Law,2Even a Court of Law outside the Land of Israel — M.E. even [one whose members] are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel,3 supra § 1, n. 14. — if they see that the people are unrestrained in [committing] sins,4Even if there is one individual who is in the habit of violating the law, he may be penalized by the Court of Law, although the punishment meted out is not in accordance with Biblical law, only that when the people as a whole are unrestrained in transgressing laws, they may enact measures as a safeguard and they may inflict penalties on any one person for the infringement of their rules even if they did not see that person committing sins unrestrainably — M.E. and [provided] that the exigencies of the hour demand it,5Tur — G. It may, however, be asked (in accordance with the interpretation of M.E.), why should an individual transgressor be considered as falling under the category of ‘exigencies of the hour?’ This should, therefore, be understood as follows: If we withhold punishment from an habitual individual sinner, others will learn from his evil ways and will likewise become unrestrained in the commission of sins. Hence, the exigencies of the hour apply here too (Tummim). Others, however, maintain that the individual may be penalized even when the foregoing reason is not applicable (Shebuth Ya‘akob) — P.Tesh. may pass judgment both [with respect to] death6Derived from San. 46a, Yeb. 90b: ‘It was taught, R. Eliezer b. Jacob stated: I heard that the Court of Law may (whenever necessary) administer punishment by lashes and impose (capital) sentences, even though not (warranted) by Biblical law; not for the purpose of disregarding the Torah but in order to make a fence around the Torah. It once happened that a man rode on horseback on the Sabbath during the Greek period and was brought before the Court of Law and was stoned, not because he was liable to this penalty, but because the needs of the hour demanded it. It also happened that a man had intercourse with his wife under a fig tree and was brought before the Court of Law and was flogged, not because he deserved it, but because the needs of the hour demanded it.’ N.Yos., however, writes that the above penalties were imposed by the Great Sanhedrin but any other Court of Law does not have the authority to administer such punishment. He adduces the following text to prove his point: San. 52b: ‘Immarta, the daughter of Tali, a Kohen, committed adultery. In consequence of that, R. Ḥama b. Tobiah had her surrounded by faggots and burnt. R. Joseph said: He (R. Ḥama) was unaware of two laws. He was unaware of R. Mathna’s statement (that burning was executed by pouring molten lead down the culprit’s throat) and was ignorant of the following Baraitha: And thou shalt come unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days (Deut. XVII, 9). This teaches that when the priesthood operates (in the Temple), the Judge operates (with respect to capital punishment) ; but when the priesthood does not operate, the Judge may not function.’ Hence, R. Ḥama, who flourished after the destruction of the Temple had no authority to impose capital punishment. N.Yos. cites additional cases to corroborate his viewpoint: Nid. 13b, San. 58b: ‘R. Ḥama had the hand of one who was accustomed to strike other people cut off.’ San. 27a: ‘The Exilarch (Resh Galutha) said to R. Abba b. Jacob, Go and investigate the matter; if he is definitely the murderer, dim his eyes.’ In these latter cases only partial punishment was administered but not full punishment in accordance with Biblical law. However, N.Yos. is opposed by the Codifiers (v. also D.M.) who hold that if the needs of the hour demand it even full punishment may be meted out including capital sentences although it would not be in accordance with Biblical law where legal warning and valid witnesses are required which would be difficult to obtain nowadays as a result of which the world would become full of violence and ultimately destroyed. Cf. ‘Jerusalem was destroyed because judgments were rendered in accordance with strict Biblical law’ (B.M. 30b). Thus RaShBA, N, and Asheri in Resp. Hence, Caro’s ruling here. , also the case of Simeon b. Shetaḥ in Mishna San. 45b who hanged eighty women at Ashkelon. and monetary [penalties]7M.K. 16a; B.K. 96b. as well as [to administer] all laws of punishment,8Ibid. even if in the case [in question] there is no valid evidence [available].9Kid. 81a; San. 26b and Tosaf. s.v. החשוד; Tur citing Yad, Sanhedrin XXIV, 4. This means that there was no legal warning given by witnesses to the offender immediately before committing the offense. For witnesses and legal warning are required only when adjudicating a Biblical law, but one who disobeys the ordinances of the country may be penalized according to the needs of the hour (N in Resp.) — M.E., ShaK. In capital cases the consent of the town Elders is required after due deliberation (B.Yos. citing RaShBA) — M.E. And if he is a stern individual, they may flog him by means of heathen authorities.10Derived from Mishna Git. 88b: ‘A heathen court may impose flogging upon a man and say to him, Do whatever the Israelite (authorities) tell you.’ Since Caro does not record here the latter statement of the Mishna (as found in Tur), viz., ‘and say to him, Do whatver the Israelite (authorities) tell you,’ it follows that even the final legal proceedings may be carried out by the heathen authorities since the offender is a very harsh person and the penalty is not in accordance with Biblical law — M.E. For only in the case of a Get (as in Git. ibid.) must the final legal proceedings be executed by Israelite authorities in order that it be considered valid — Nethiboth. , also infra § 26. And they have authority to expropriate his property and to forfeit it according to whatever they see fit in order to fence in the lawlessness of the generation.11Tur on the authority of Yad, Sanhedrin XXIV, 4-10 — G. Derived from M.K. 16a where Scriptural verses are adduced whence we derive that we have the authority to excommunicate persons refusing to obey the summons of the Court, to pronounce the Ḥerem (v. Glos.), to forfeit property, to curse, to smite, to pluck one’s hair, to adjure (so that one desists from malpractices), to fetter, to arrest and to prosecute. ‘We administer flogging on account of an evil rumour, because it is said, Nay (al), my sons; for it is no good report that I hear’ (I Sam. II, 24) — Kid. 81a. This has reference to an uninterrupted rumour not due to intimidation and where no enemies are about who might have published the rumour — Yeb. 25a. Cf. Tur. O.Ḥ. § 1 , also Git. 36b on the Rabbis’ power to expropriate one’s property; also Meg. 25b where it is stated that it is permissible to abuse a person of ill fame. The latter statement refers to an ordinary person but not to a scholar (RaN). Cf. Men. 99b: ‘Resh Lakish said, A scholar-disciple who has committed a misdeed should not be reproached in public because it is said, Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night (Hos. IV, 5), that is to say, Keep it dark like night.’ The par. passage in M.K. 17a reads that ‘they do not place him under the ban.’ Some Later Authorities rule that the Court of Law has the power only to declare a debt cancelled but they cannot take possession of the money or the like on behalf of a person before it reaches the latter’s hand (Birke Yosef). Others (on the basis of Git. 36b) hold that the Court of Law does have this authority even before it reaches the latter’s hand — P.Tesh. All their acts, however, should be [done] for the sake of Heaven.12Cf. San. 46a: ‘Not with the purpose of disregarding the Torah, but in order to safeguard it.’ And [this should be executed] only [by] a great personage of the generation13Derived from B.K. 96b regarding the man who misappropriated a pair of oxen and was penalized by R. Naḥman, whence we see that only a distinguished personage like R. Naḥman who was the son-in-law of the Nasi’s house had the power to impose penalties. or [by] the representatives of the town14 B.B. 8b. whom they [i.e., the people] have recognized as the Court of Law over them.15Tur has שהמחום רבים עליהם ‘whom the public recognized as authorities over themselves.’ Gloss: And thus is the accepted practice everywhere, [viz.,] that the representatives of the town are regarded in their [own] town [as authoritative] as the [former] Great Sanhedrin.16Mord. (B.M. II beg.) on the authority of R. Gershon states: ‘Whosoever is appointed a leader of the community is regarded like the mightiest of the mighty and Jepthah in his generation is like Samuel in his generation (R.H. 25b) and whatever he does is considered binding.’ Thus also RaShBA — M.E. They may administer flogging and impose [death] penalties and their expropriation [of one's property] is considered valid according to the adopted custom,17MaHaRIK (Rt. I, XIV) writes that even according to the opinion that the representatives of the town have the power to enact measures as they see fit, it applies only to communal needs but not with respect to cancelling a debt of one individual for the benefit of another which does not fall under the category of communal needs. Thus also Isserlein in his Decisions. Furthermore, only one who is a distinguished personage in his generation may expropriate property — M.E. Cf. supra n. 13. If the custom in the community is to submit the matter to arbitration by one litigant choosing one person and the other litigant choosing another person and the Head of the Court of Law acting as the third, — this practice should not be altered — P.Tesh. although there are some who differ and are of the opinion that the representatives of the town have no power in these [matters] save that they [have the authority] to compel the community in [observing] whatever was an adopted practice heretofore,18B.B. 8b: ‘The townspeople have a right to stipulate meassures, prices of food and wages of labourers and to remove (place outside of the protection of the law — Rashi) those who disregard the terms fixed by the authorities (ולהסיע על קיצתן). The dissenting opinion takes ולהסיע as referring to ‘measures etc.,’ i.e., just as in the latter case it must be with the consent of all, so too in the case of ‘terms fixed by the authorities,’ the consent of all is required. The first opinion takes ולהסיע as a separate measure. Hence, the consent of all is not required — W.G. Cf. also Y. Meg. III, 2(74a) : ‘The seven representatives of the town are regarded as the (entire) town. What are we treating of? If they (the townspeople) accepted them, then even if one (was appointed his decision should be binding upon all the townspeople) ; if they did not accept them, then even many (i.e., more than seven cannot enforce their rulings upon the townspeople). We, therefore, deal here with an undefined case (i.e., the townspeople appointed them to look after the communal matters, without specifying which matter they delegated to them, and the town representatives sold aught without consulting the people, we are therefore, informed that their transaction is binding).’ or they accepted upon themselves [a new measure] with the consent of all [the townspeople],19e., by mere speech the matter becomes binding even in a matter concerning which no adopted practice existed formerly — M.E. but they may change naught in any matter that would involve a gain for one person and a loss for another20For this does not come under the category of safeguarding a cause — M.E. , also Ḥid. Hag. P. Tesh cites the case of the controversy around the Sulzbach edition of the Talmud. The latter was forbidden to be printed until a certain period would elapse after the Amsterdam edition of the Talmud was published. Certain authorities ruled that the purchasers of the Sulzbach ed. were prohibited to study in it. Zikron Ya‘akob, however, on the basis of the present ruling, held that since this prohibition would involve a gain for one (i.e., the Amsterdam publisher) and a loss for the other (i.e., the Sulzbach publisher), the law is that those who had already bought the Sulzbach edition were permitted to use it. , also P.Tesh. to Y.D. § 208, 5; § 236,  or to declare a debt cancelled without the consent of all [the townspeople].21Mord. to B.K. X — G. Nevertheless, [in these matters] we follow the adopted custom of the town, especially if the [townspeople] accepted them [to render decisions] in every matter.22 infra § 23 Thus seems to me [to be the correct view].23 Y.D. § 228 on the laws pertaining to ordinances and Ḥerem for the sake of the public welfare — G. The later authorities state in their Responsa that one who has been sentenced to flogging may give forty gold coins instead of the flogging.24MaHaRIW s. 147 and R. Menaḥem of Merseburg — G. , Ket. 46a where a monetary fine is designated as flogging. This is, however, not stated as a law, only that they decided thus because [of the needs of the] hour, but [in reality] the Court of Law has the authority to flog him or to confiscate [his] property as they see fit according to the matter [in hand] in order to safeguard a cause.25 infra § 425 Gloss — G.

Ika (since they both agree that laymen Judges are legally qualified to adjudicate monetary cases) ? — They differ with respect to the opinion of Samuel who said: If two laymen Judges adjudicated a monetary case, their judgment holds good but they are called an arrogant court. Raba (who requires three Biblically) does not agree with Samuel; whereas R. Aḥa, does.’ Consequently, continues ShaK, since we do not rule in accordance with Samuel (v. infra par. 2 beg.), we must say that the law agrees with Raba, viz., that Biblically three Mumḥin are necessary, for the term ‘Elohim’ denoting ‘Judges’ is found three times in Ex. XXII, 6-8 with respect to cases of larceny, and on the basis of the principle that there is ‘an interweaving of Biblical sections’ עירוב פרשיות (i.e., clauses of one section are taken over for interpretative purposes to a succeeding section, in this case the term ‘Elohim’ is taken over to the section in Ex. XXII, 24 which deals with cases of indebtedness). Hence, three Mumḥin Judges should be required even in cases of indebtedness. However, this requirement was relaxed and three laymen Judges suffice on account of the reason advanced by R. Ḥanina, viz., ‘in order not to close the door against borrowers’ (people would refuse to advance loans should they subsequently meet with difficulties in having to procure Mumḥin Judges in order to collect their debts). This is also evident from Asheri, for he decides in favour of R. Abbahu that the adjudication of two Judges is invalid contra Samuel (v. supra this note). Furthermore, Asheri states explicitly that the law follows R. Abbahu since we have an established principle that beginning with Abaye and Raba the law always rests with the Later Authorities. Consequently, the law is decided in favour of Raba who disagrees with Samuel. Thus also Alfasi, RABaN and N.Yos. Maim. ruling (v. Yad ibid.) presents the following difficulties: a) On the one hand Maim. rules that three Judges are required and on the other hand, he states that one Mumḥeh is permitted to try monetary cases, which is in agreement with R. Aḥa. But, as we have seen above, R. Aḥa accepts Samuel’s dictum, and such being the case, Maim. should likewise accept Samuel’s ruling that two Judges are sufficient. The same difficulty is found in SeMaG. b) According to B.K. 84b and Git. 88b, the reason why we may adjudicate monetary cases nowadays is because we act as agents of the former authoritative Judges (Elohim). Thus also Yad, Sanhedrin V, 8 and SeMaG (v. supra § 1 notes). Hence, Biblically, monetary cases are tried by Mumḥin, i.e., in accord with Raba, for according to R. Aḥa, one laymen Judge would be sufficient today (v. Kesef Mishneh to Yad, ibid. II, 10 who raises the same question and cites Resp. of RaShBA in order to remove the above difficulties. Cf. also Leḥem Mishneh ibid.). ShaK writes that the solution of the latter authorities is strained. A.H. removes the above difficulties as follows: Samuel’s dictum that ‘If two judges tried monetary cases their decision holds good,’ refers only to Biblical adjudication. And needless to say that the one (R. Aḥa) who maintains that Biblically one Judge is qualified to try monetary cases will certainly hold that if two adjudicated the matter, their decision is valid and they are Biblically designated a Court of Law. However, Rabbinically, all agree that three Judges are required on account of idlers who are unversed in the law. This is what is meant by the text (v. supra), ‘What is the difference between Raba and R. Aḥa? — They differ with respect to the opinion of Samuel who said: ‘If two Judges etc.,’ i.e., Biblically, the decision given by two judges is valid and they are designated a Court of Law according to Samuel. Therefore, the Gemara does not state that the difference between Raba and R. Aḥa centers around the difference of opinion between Samuel and R. Abbahu (the latter holding that the decision of two is invalid), for as far as a valid judgment is concerned, R. Aḥa and Samuel agree with R. Abbahu that three are required Rabbinically, on account of idlers. Samuel and R. Aḥa only differ Biblically. and every [group of] three [Judges] is called a Court of Law even if they be laymen.2San. 2b-3a.  previous note. For it is impossible that there should not be among them [at least] one who has a knowledge of logical inferences in [civil] laws.3San. 3a. The expression, ‘who has a knowledge of logical inferences in (civil) laws’ (דיודע סברות בדינים) taken from Tur, is not equivalent to the Talmudic term סביר, i.e., one who has the capacity to reason even regarding matters concerning which he did not study. For this would be equivalent to a Mumḥeh (authoritative Judge). , Shab. 63a a.e. The expression used here has reference to one who merely received reasons for certain laws from others, but is himself not endowed with the power of reasoning — M.E. (v. also Perisha). ShaK agrees with M.E. regarding the term סביר, but maintains that one of the Judges must be versed in traditions (גמיר used in San. ibid.). Thus also R. Meir of Padua contra BaḤ who writes that גמיר refers to partial knowledge. The ruling here, viz., that one is required to be versed in the law follows Asheri contra Mord. who requires the three Judges to be versed in the law even if they have no reasoning power. Thus also R. Zeraḥyah and N. However, if there is not among them [at least] one [who has such knowledge], they are disqualified to judge.4Tur on the authority of his father Asheri to San. I beg. — G. Cf. San. 23a. Three Judges who are unversed in the law may adjudicate monetary cases provided the litigants expressly stated that they agree to accept them as Judges — ShaK, P.Tesh. , infra § 8 and § 22. Nevertheless, they may receive the pleas [of the contesting parties] and forward them to one who is qualified to render legal decisions.5R. Meir of Padua s. 43 — G. They may try the defendant6Lit. ‘the person.’ against his will7San. 5a, Tosaf. s.v. דן. Cf. also San. 6a. Thus also Asheri and Sefer ha-Terumoth. Should there be a difference of opinion among the litigants as to the type of adjudication in the contested matter, one demanding that it should be tried by a judicial Court and the other maintaining that businessmen should be appointed to arbitrate the case, — the law is that if the accepted local custom is to submit such a case to arbitration by businessmen, this custom should be followed since ‘an accepted custom overrides a law’ (Y. Yeb. XII, 1(12c) ; Y. B.M. VII, 1(11b) ; Maseketh Soferim XIV, 18) — R.A. Eger, P.Tesh. if the latter8Lit. ‘the defendant.’ declines to come down before Court,9San. and Tosaf. ibid. or he is not willing to attend the Court with the plaintiff in his10e., the plaintiff’s. home town.11San. 31b.  infra § 14. It is only the defendant who cannot refuse to go to Court with the plaintiff in the latter’s home town, but the plaintiff may compel the defendant to go with him and have the case tried at the place of Assembly (בית הועד) i.e., the meeting place of scholars. And as to the Supreme Court even the defendant may request the plaintiff to have the case tried there (v. infra § 13) — M.E. But if he is willing to attend the Court with him12The plaintiff. in his10e., the plaintiff’s. home town, only that he is not pleased with the three [Judges] whom the plaintiff has chosen, — then [the law is that] each [litigant] chooses one [Judge and the two Judges together choose a third].13San. 23a; ibid. 3a, Tosaf. s.v. אי אפשר and cf. infra § 8, 1, Gloss. Gloss: As stated infra § 13. It seems to me [that this applies] only to Judges who are not permanent, but if there are permanent Judges in town he cannot say, 'I will attend Court in their presence only on [the condition that] each [litigant] chooses [one Judge and the two Judges together choose a third]'.14The defendant may, however, demand that more Judges be added to the number of the permanent Judges — Tummim, P.Tesh. Thus is the accepted custom in our town. , infra § 22, par. 1 end.",

    "text_en": "[If] less than three [Judges tried a monetary case] their decision is not binding,15San. 2b in accord with R. Abbahu. Thus also Alfasi, Asheri and Yad, Sanhedrin II, 10. The following sources in Rabbinic literature indicate that R. Abbahu’s view was the accepted law: San. 29b-30a: Regarding a deed of a debtor’s admission of indebtedness in the presence of witnesses (אודיתא) where it is taken for granted that the document was legally drawn up in the presence of a Court of three. Ket. 22a (cf. San. ibid.) : If one of the three Judges necessary for the authentication of signatures on documents (קיום שטרות) died before signing it, the document should contain such wording. So too, in B.B. 165b. B.M. 31b: ‘Go and bring three people in whose presence you made the division (of partnership).’ San. 2b-3a: Raba agrees with R. Abbahu that if two adjudicated a monetary case their decision is not binding. Thus also the opinion of R. Joḥanan and Resh Lakish in Y. San. I, 1(18a) cited by Tosaf., San. 2b s.v. דברי הכל. Mord. a.o. write that even Samuel who regards the decision of two Judges binding (v. supra par. 1) will agree that in the cases of אודיתא (admission of indebtedness) and קיום שטרות (authentication of signatures) mentioned above, three Judges are required. As to the statement in San. 30 and parallel references, ‘But perhaps the Rabbis of Rabbana Ashi’s academy agreed with Samuel,’ — it should be understood as refering to other cases of adjudication (v. Hag. Imre Baruk). This also follows from Alfasi and Maim., the latter holding that even a Mumḥeh is not qualified to deal alone in the above-mentioned matters, although in other cases he is qualified. BaḤ writes that if two Judges adjudicated a monetary case and exacted money from one person and gave it to another person and the latter betrothed a woman with this money, — we should be stringent and consider the marriage binding and in order to dissolve the marriage a Get (Bill of Divorce) is required. ShaK opposes BaḤ’s ruling. even [if] they did not render an erroneous decision,16Derived from San. 6a. unless the litigants accepted them [to abide by their ruling],17Ibid. or [in the case of] one who is a recognized Mumḥeh.18San. 5a; Bek. 37a. Tur citing R. Sherira Gaon, writes: ‘Whoever is considered like R. Naḥman in his generation (San. 6a) and is versed in Mishna and Talmud and likewise is an expert in weighing opinions and deciding between opposing parties (שיקול הדעת) and has perused legal texts for a number of years and was examined numerous times and gave no erroneous decision, — such a one is a recognized Mumḥeh.’ On the term Mumḥeh, cf. also Shab. VI, 2 and Gemara ibid. 53b — M.E. Nowadays we do not conduct proceedings of adjudication [of monetary cases by] a recognized Mumḥeh so that he judge [not] alone against the will of an individual.19MaHaRIW s. 147 — G. Cf. B.M. 67b and Tosaf. s.v. רבינא; Bek. 36b and Tosaf. s.v. פסק. The same ruling applies nowadays with respect to the release of vows where a single expert cannot deal with such matters, but a Court of three is required. , Tur and Sh. ‘Ar. Y.D. § 228, 1; § 243, 8, Gloss. The same applies to imposing the fine of a ‘Litra of gold’ in the case where one insults a scholar (v. supra § 1, n. 55) — M.E. However, if one recognized Judge rendered an erroneous decision, he is not liable to make restitution. In this sense the term Mumḥeh is still applicable — ShaK. Every [group] that does not consist of three [Judges],20Tur on the authority of Yad, Sanhedrin V, 18; San. 31b. and [the litigants] did not accept them [to abide by their decision]21 Rashi, San. 5a, s.v. אי קבלוך. and they are not recognized Mumḥin,22Tur — G. Hence, if they are experts (מומחין), even if less than three, an admission of indebtedness made before them is considered valid. Thus Tur on the authority of Asheri. Maim., however, holds (Yad, ibid.) that even if they are experts and duly ordained, — as long as they are less than three, an admission made before them is not binding. But if they are three, even laymen, it would be valid. This is the meaning of Caro’s statement, ‘even if they are duly ordained,’ i.e., even if they are experts (although Yad has ‘even if he is a rcognized Mumḥeh,’ it applies equally to two experts). Consequently, Isserles’ Gloss is difficult to comprehend, for it should have been stated as a dissenting opinion. Perhaps Isserles should be understood thus: ‘and they are not Judges who are recognized by the public.’ But this is a strained interpretation — M.E. ShaK rejects the interpretation of M.E. For even if the Judges are recognized by the public, their decision would still be invalid since they are less than three. The reason, therefore, why Isserles does not record this as a dissenting opinion is duel to the fact that the term ‘duly ordained’ (סמוכים) employed by Caro is unclear. For Judges may be duly ordained and yet not be experts (מומחין). , Tur and Asheri infra § 25 that ‘Ordination’ holds good even for a non-Mumḥeh. The law, however, is that even if they are duly ordained and also experts, — yet, if their number is less than three, an admission of indebtedness made in their presence is not binding (contra Isserles). Thus also ‘Ir Shushan — ShaK. A.H. rules that if the litigants accepted the Judges (although their number is less than three) or one Judge who was a recognized authority (מומחח לרבים), e.g., if the people accepted a Rabbi to judge all monetary matters alone, the latter has the status of a Court of Law and an admission made in his presence is binding and the litigants cannot alter their original pleas. Likewise, one who denies aught in his presence and subsequently witnesses appeared and refuted his evidence, is presumed to be a liar even in the future (v. Sh. ‘Ar. anon). So too, may this single Judge compel one to appear before him for judgment and may hear testimony, save that in one respect there is a difference between a single Judge and a Court of Law of three. For in the latter case, an admission made in their presence is regarded as an admission made in writing and another Court may adjudicate the matter in accordance with the testimony and the pleas heard by the first Court of three even if the testimony etc., is submitted by the first Court to the second Court in writing. But if one was accepted as the recognized authority, although, as stated above, an admission made in his presence is regarded as made before a Court of Law of three, and should he on the basis of the information he obtains, render a decision, it would be binding, — yet, if after hearing the testimony and obtaining all the information in the case, — for some reason, it is submitted to another Court for final adjudication, the evidence presented to the second Court for consideration is regarded as having the status of oral testimony offered by a witness testifying to what he has heard from an eye-witness’ (Bek. 36a a.e.) which is invalid. Consequently, the second Court cannot render a decision on the basis of the submitted evidence. And if this testimony is submitted in writing to the second Court, the latter would have to hear the evidence again directly from the contesting parties or the party that made the admission, for the law is that testimony must be offered by witnesses orally and not from their writing (derived from Deut. XIX, 15, At the mouth of two witnesses … shall a matter be established — Git. 71a). But if the single recognized authority completes the adjudication himself, his decision is as binding as the one given by a Court of three — Nethiboth. On testimony offered before a Court, v. infra § 39, 12 and on the authentication of documents, v. infra § 46, 4, Gloss. even [if] they are duly ordained in the Land of Israel,23Cf. supra § 1, n. 1. — [the law is that] an admission of indebtedness made in their presence is regarded as an admission made outside the Court24 San. 29b and infra § 39, 7. and they [the litigants] may alter their [original] pleas which they put forth before them [the Judges].25B.B. 31a. One who denies aught before them [the Judges] and subsequently witnesses arrived [and refuted him], is not presumed to be a liar.26B.M. 17a and Alfasi a.l. However, if he declared before them: ‘You are my witnesses’ or he phrased his statement in the form of a complete admission, he is presumed to be a liar (v. infra §32, 1 and § 81) — M.E. ShaK opposes M.E. and writes that even if he stated: ‘You are my witnesses,’ they are still not regarded as a Court of Law, but only as witnesses. Hence, if he later alters his pleas and states, ‘I paid you,’ he is not presumed to be a liar (v. infra § 79, 9). Cf. however, viewpoint of Nethiboth and A.H. supra n. 2 However, regarding the [Court which consists of] three [Judges], although they are not duly ordained, — [the law is that] the admission of indebtedness made in their presence is regarded as one made before a competent Court of Law. Likewise, in [the case of] one who denies [aught] and subsequently witnesses came [and refuted him], — he is presumed to be a liar and cannot amend his pleas.",

San. 5a, Tosaf. s.v. כגון. Cf. however, Y. San. I, 1(18a): ‘R. Abbahu was sitting alone in judgment in the Turbulent (מרדתא. So Jastrow) Synagogue’ at Caesarea. Said his disciples to him, Rabbi, have you not taught us thus: Judge not alone? — Said he to them, Since they (the people) see me sitting alone in judgment and yet come to see me (with their cases), it is as though they accepted me (to abide by my decision) and it has thus been taught: When does this apply (that one must not judge alone) ? — If they did not accept him, but if they did accept (him), he may judge even alone.’ One should be careful nowadays not to judge alone even if the litigants accepted him to abide by his decisions, unless he expressly stated, ‘I am not competent to judge matters of strict law (דין תורה) and in case I give an erroneous decision, I am not to be held liable,’ or if it is a matter with which he is familiar and experienced — ShaK. A.H. disagrees with ShaK and states that the above stipulation is unnecessary, for since everyone is aware that he is the only Judge in town, they rely upon his judgment.

    "text_en": "Although a Court of Law of three is considered complete, — [yet], whenever they [the Judges] are many it is regarded as praiseworthy and it is better that the law be decided29The translation follows Maim. and Tur who have שיחתך in the Niph‘al form. Caro has שיחתוך in the Kal which is incorrect. by eleven than by ten [Judges].30San. 7b: ‘Whenever a case was presented to R. Huna he used to call a meeting and gather ten scholars in order, as he put it, that each of them carry off a chip of the beam’ (i.e., share the responsibility with him). Thus also Yad, Sanhedrin II, 13 and Tur a.l. When the Judges are many, they all examine the case very carefully and there is a better chance for a correct decision to be reached. Actually the number ten mentioned here is inexact, for a Court of Law must not be comprised of an even number, for if their opinions were halved no decision could be reached. The number ten is mentioned because in the cited passage regarding R. Huna, he summoned ten scholars. However, there it means that he gathered ten authorities excluding himself — M.E. Perisha. It is required that all who sit in the Court of Law31e., all those who sit in judgment, but regarding a disciple who sits before his master, it is not necessary that he be a scholar. As long as he is not an uncultured person, it is permissible — M.E. be scholars and worthy [of their office].32Sheb. 30b: ‘Our Rabbis taught: Whence do we know that a Judge should not permit an uncultured disciple to sit before him (so that he should not be misled by his erroneous opinions)? — For it is said, From a false matter keep far’ (Ex. XXIII, 7). Thus also Yad, Sanhedrin XXII, 2 and Tur a.l. Cf. infra § 7, 10; § 9, 6. It is forbidden for a wise man to sit in judgment until he knows with whom he sits lest he sit with people who are not suitable33San. 23a: ‘The pure-minded of the people of Jerusalem would not act thus … they would not sit in judgment unless they knew who was to sit with them.’ Thus also Yad, Sanhedrin II, 14 and Tur a.l. and is [then] found to be included in a council of conspirators34San. 26a (ref. to Is. VIII, 12) and as such cannot be included for the purpose of a decision. , also Yad ibid and Tur a.l. and not in a Court of Law. One who is not an authorized Judge [Mumḥeh] and the litigants did not accept him upon themselves,35Thus Tur. Caro has עליו ‘upon himself,’ i.e., upon each one of the litigants. Derived from San. 6a. This has reference to one who is neither versed in the law nor possesses reasoning power. One who is versed in the law but does not possess the power of reasoning is regarded as a Mumḥeh (authoritative Judge) and if he obtains authorization (נטילת רשות) his decision is binding. But one who in addition to being versed in the law also has reasoning power, is referred to as מומחה לרבים (an authoritative Judge recognized by the public) by Maim. — M.E., Perisha. This interpretation is rejected by ShaK. , infra § 25, 3- although he obtained authorization from the Exilarch,36Lit. ‘head of the Golah’ ראש הגולה. , Jer. XXVIII, 6. Likewise, if the Court of Law granted him authorization in error (v. Yad, Sanhedrin IV, 15). his decision is not binding,37San. 7b regarding the case of an incompetent Judge who was appointed by the members of the Nasi’s household. Tur and Maim. (Yad, Sanhedrin VI, 4) add that if he erred and exacted money from one litigant and gave it to the other litigant, he is held liable — M.E. even if he did not err [in his ruling],38San. 5a. and [consequently] each one of the litigants may, if he so desires, retract and plead [his case anew] before a [competent] Court of Law.39Tur has ‘another Court of Law,’ which is incorrect, for this would imply that the first is also considered a valid Court of Law. Maim. and Caro after him omit the word אחר (another) — M.E. Cf. also Caro’s text infra § 25,  Gloss: Authorization which a ruler nowadays grants [to an individual Judge] is of no consequence.40In accord with San. 5a, Tosaf s.v. דהכא. Rashi (ibid. s.v. שרודים) however, states that the ruler’s sanction or authorization is valid. However, if the community accepted him in accord with the written decree of the ruler, he may act as Judge.41Tur — G. For we might have thought that since the people accepted him against their will, he should not be permitted to judge. We are, therefore, informed otherwise. However, if he gave an erroneous decision, he is not exempt from making restitution. Needless to say that he may judge if the community accepted him willingly without the ruler’s authorization (BaḤ) — ShaK. But if he is versed in the law and has reasoning power, their acceptance in accord with the ruler’s authorization exempts him from any liability whatsoever. Thus Tur. Not so according to Maim. who writes that the ruler’s authorization is of no conseuqence in case of an erroneous decision, even where they accepted him. Thus BaḤ. ShaK opposes BaḤ and states that no such inference may be drawn from Maim. And some say that if he [the Judge] is versed in law and possesses reasoning power, — the ruler's authorization has legal effect for him,42RIBaSh s. 271 — G. For if he is unversed in law, even the Exilarch’s authorization is invalid. , supra n. 40. Although Isserles writes supra par. 2 that ‘nowadays we do not conduct proceedings of adjudication (of monetary cases by) a recognized Mumḥeh so that he judge (not) alone against the will of an individual,’ yet, if he is versed in law and has reasoning power, the ruler’s authorization qualifies him even nowadays to judge alone and to be exempt from liability in the case of error as in the case of one who obtained authorization from the Exilarch who was also appointed by the ruler — ShaK. Cf. infra § 8, 1, Gloss; supra par. 1, Gloss; infra § 25, 2, Gloss. or [likewise, the authorization of] the officer who was appointed in his town [has legal effect for him], — for this comes under the category of the law of the State,43B.K. 113b. [viz.,], to appoint [as] Judges and Magistrates whomever he desires.44They must however, be versed in the law and posses reasoning power as supra — M.E. Nevertheless, whosoever does this without the permission of the community, annoys the general public45Ber. 55a: ‘A leader is not appointed over a community unless we first consult with it, as it says, See, the Lord hath called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri’ (Ex. XXXV, 30). One who disobeys this is subject to the ban imposed by R. Tam, RaShBaM, RABaN and their associates — Tummim, P.Tesh. and is destined to give an account [of his actions in the world to come].46RaShBA Resp. s. 637 — G.",

    "text_en": "A person may take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests.1B.K. 27b: ‘It has been stated: Rab Judah said: A man may not take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests. R. Naḥman said: A man may take the law into his own hands for the sake of safeguarding his interests. Where there is an irretrievable loss pending, all the authorities agree that a man may take the law into his own hands in order to protect his interests. They differ only where there is no irretrievable loss pending. R. Judah holds that a man may not take the law into his own hands in order to protect his interests, for since no irretrievable loss is pending let him go to the Judge; whereas, R. Naḥman maintains that a man may take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests, for since he acts according to the law why should he trouble himself (to go to Court) ?’ The law is decided in favour of R. Naḥman. Thus also Yad, Sanhedrin II, 13. If he sees aught that belongs to him in the hand of another person who robbed it [from him], he may take it from his hand,2B.K. ibid.: ‘Ben Bag Bag stated: Do not enter (stealthily) thy neighbour’s courtyard in order to take aught without his knowledge even if it belongs to you lest you will appear to him as a thief. You may, however, break his teeth and say to him (the alleged offender), I am taking possession of what is mine.’ This deals with a case where the loss is not an irretrievable one and supports R. Naḥman’s viewpoint. Furthermore, we might have thought that the legal principle, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands’ applies only to a case where one comes to seize aught that is in the possession of another individual, in which case, the latter, in order to safeguard his interests may take the law into his own hands, but not so in the case where the article is already in the possession of the offender. Ben Bag Bag, therefore, in stating that a man has a right to say, ‘I am taking possession of what is mine,’ informs us otherwise. and if the latter makes a stand against him, he may strike him3 previous note on Ben Bag Bag’s view and B.K. 27b: Concerning R. Ḥisda’s query: ‘What is the fine to be imposed in the case of one who wounds with the blade of a hoe or with the handle of the hoe? … R. Naḥman asked for the circumstances of the case … There was a well that belonged to two persons, They used it on alternate days. One of them came and used it on a day that was not his. The other said to him: This day is mine! But when the latter paid no attention, he took the blade of a hoe and struck him with it. R. Naḥman replied : He ought to have given him a hundred blows with the hoe.’ Although this case would harmonize even with R. Judah’s view (v. supra n. 1) since it involved an irretrievable loss (for there would be no water left in the well by the time they go to Court), — yet, we see that he was permitted to strike him, whence it follows that even according to the view that one may take the law into his own hands even where no irreparable loss is pending, he may also strike the offender. until he releases it, — if he cannot save [the stolen article] otherwise4Tur — G. Thus also Asheri. Derived from B.K. 27a in the case of the ox that threw himself on the back of another ox with the intention to kill, where it is pointed out that one may not cause damage to a tort-feasant animal if it was possible to save his own chattel otherwise, even where there is an irretrievable loss involved. Much more so in the case of striking an individual in order to protect one’s interests where it is possible to do so without having to resort to bodily injury. — even if it is aught that does not involve an irretrievable loss should he [have to] wait until he takes legal proceedings against him,5B.K. 27b in accord with R. Naḥman (v. supra n. 1). Tur has, ‘and if his opponent is dissatisfied with him and took him to law and they (the Judges) found that the claimant had acted in accordance with the law, they do not try his case again.’ This is explained by ShaK as follows: If his opponent states that he is prepared to go to law with him and to obey the Court’s decision on the condition that the seized article be returned to him and that he will settle the case by making payment in another form, we do not try the case again, since the seizure was found to be legal. provided he can prove that [what] he takes [is] his own in accordance with the law.6Tur and Asheri. Derived from B.K. 117a: ‘Two people quarrelled about a net. One said, It is mine, and the other said, It is mine. One of them ultimately went and handed it over to the Parangaria (a public service) for confiscation. Said Abaye, he should have the right to plead, When I handed over the article it was my own property that I surrendered. Said Raba to him: Is he then believed if he says so? — Raba therefore, said: We impose a ban upon him until he returns the net and appears before the Court.’ It follows that only if he were able to prove that it is his do we apply the principle, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands.’ Otherwise not. , also M.K. 17a where it is stated that ‘a scholar may take the law into his own hands when he is absolutely certain as to the law,’ whence it follows that one who is not a scholar must be prepared to establish that it is definitely his. For if he cannot prove that the article is his, then not only is he forbidden to strike him and seize the article, but he is forbidden to take the article even without resorting to force. This is applicable only if he seizes the article in the presence of witnesses, but if there are no witnesses present, he may seize it, since then he would be believed before the Court on the principle of Miggo (v. supra § 1, n. 50) — M.E., ShaK. Nevertheless, he has no right to seize a pledge for his debt [when it matures].7For if he takes a pledge of him, he transgresses the negative precept, When thou dost lend thy neighbour any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his home to fetch his pledge (Deut. XXIV, 10). B.M. 113a: ‘One who lends money to his fellow, may take a pledge of him (when the debt falls due) only through the Court.’ Not only is he prohibited to enter the debtor’s home in order to seize the pledge, but even outside of the home it is permitted only for the Court officer to seize it forcibly according to Samuel (ibid.). If, however, the borrower denies the debt, the lender may seize the pledge without witnesses in order that he be believed on the principle of Miggo (v. supra n. 6). For the reason why it is forbidden for him proper to seize the pledge is that he can seize the pledge through the Court, but in this case where he cannot collect it through Court, he may seize it himself (v. infra § 97, 15). Cf. also infra § 61, 6. Thus Sha‘ar Mishpat. K.H. reject this — P.Tesh. Gloss: On account of the reason which will be explained infra § 97, par. 6. Some say [that this applies] only to [seizing a pledge] for his actual debt [which was incurred through a loan], but if he owes him [aught] not on account of a loan,8B.M. 115a: ‘Our Rabbis taught: Thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge: You may not enter his (the debtor’s) house, but you may enter the house of the surety (to seize for a debt), and so it is written, Take his garment that is surety for a stranger (Prov. XX, 16) ; also, My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, thou art snared with the words of thy mouth. Do this now, my son and deliver thyself when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself and make sure thy friend (ibid. VI, 1-3). Another interpretation: You may not enter his house, but you may enter (to distrain) for porterage fees, payment for hiring asses, the hotel bill etc.’ Hence we see that in the latter cases one may take the law into his own hands and seize even a pledge. or where he [the creditor] does not have to take a pledge, — for it [the pledge] is already in his possession as a deposit — or [in the case where] he discovered it in the possession of another person9 supra n. 7. For the prohibition applies only to entering the debtor’s home and seizing it directly from him forcibly, but if the pledge was already in the hand of the creditor as a deposit, or where he seizes it from another person, not from the debtor, it is permissible. Especially according to Tosaf. (B.M. 113a, s.v. אימא) who write that the prohibition against the creditor seizing forcibly from the debtor, even outside of the latter’s home, is only a Rabbinical measure lest he seize in his (the debtor’s) home. According to Zohar, Bamidbar 119a, it is forbidden to seize even a pledge that was deposited with the creditor (K.H.). R. Menaḥem Azariah da Fano states that if the deposit preceded the loan, it is permissible to retain it — P.Tesh. — he is permitted to seize it.10RIBaSh s. 396 — G. And some say that we apply the principle 'A man may take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests' only with respect to an article [concerning which] it is clearly evident to him that it is his, e.g., where one robbed him,11B.K. 27b in accord with Ben Bab Bag (v. supra n. 2) whence we see that in the case of an article concerning which it is clearly evident that it belongs to him, he may enter and take it by force. It is clear that the article in question was stolen. The principle, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands’ has reference only to a case where the person proper came to inflict damage intentionally, but does not refer to his chattel which does this without the owner’s knowledge — P.Tesh. or one desires to rob him,12e., it is permissible to withhold one from robbing him and if necessary, he may strike him. Derived from B.K. 27b regarding the case of the well (v. supra n. 3). or one desires to cause him damage,13B.K. 28a in the case of the ox and the woman who saved her husband (v. Deut. XXV, 12).  supra n. 4. [in which case] he may save that which belongs to him, but if one has become liable to him on account of a [previous] robbery or on account of other grounds, [we do] not [apply this principle].14Mord. and N.Yos. to B.K. III — G. Derived from Ber. 5b: ‘It once happened that four hundred casks of wine belonging to R. Huna turned sour. R. Judah, the brother of Sala, the Pious, and the other scholars … went to visit him and said to him: The master ought to examine his deeds (perhaps your misfortune is a result of some sin). He said to them: Do you suspect me? They replied: Is the Holy One, Blessed be He, suspect of punishing without justice? — He said to them: If somebody heard of anything against me, let him speak out. They replied: We heard that the master does not give his tenant his (lawful share in the) vine twigs. He replied: Does he leave me any? He steals them all! They replied: This is exactly what people say, If you steal from a thief, you also have a taste of it.’ Mord. maintains that the sin of R. Huna was that he took the law into his own hands, and, though, a scholar may act so (v. supra n. 6), yet, it applies only to an article which is absolutely his, but in a case where the claim has to be proved and collection has to be made (מחוסר גוביינא), even a scholar (according to this interpretation) may not take the law into his own hands. And only he alone may take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests, but he is forbidden to do [this] through a heathen Court.15Terumath ha-Deshen s. 304 — G. , infra § 26. However, if he violated [the law] and did [this] by means of the [government] officers, — provided he was not able to save [aught] in another manner, — [the law is that] his act cannot be undone.16 MaHaRIK Rt. 161 — G. Derived from B.K. 117a regarding the case of the net. , supra n. 6 for text. This is in accord with the interpretation of Mord. of Is he then believed if he says so? i.e., he could not prove that it was his. If he were able to save his article by other means but went to a heathen Court through which he obtained his article, and subsequently slanderized the offender, he must pay damages as in the case of an informer — ShaK. Seizing forcibly in a doubtful case is not valid through a heathen Court (R.A.Eger) — P.Tesh. Some say that [the principle] 'a man may take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests' is applicable only when he inflicts injury upon his fellow, e.g., when he strikes him.17And acts as a Judge (v. MaHaRIK ibid.) — ShaK. Consequently, one may [so] act only when he can make certain that the [article in question] is his own, but a mere seizure, [viz., in the case] where he seized a pledge [without having to resort to force — the law is that] one may do [this] in any case and subsequently he goes down with him to Court.18MaHaRIK Rt. 161 — G. Derived from B.K. 27b concerning R. Ḥisda’s query (v. text supra n. 3), whence it follows that the principle, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands’ refers only to a case where the claimant is certain that the article is his and may even resort to force in order to safeguard his interests. Consequently, seizing forcibly a pledge where both the Biblical prohibition Thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge (Deut. XXIV, 10) as well as the Rabbinical prohibition (v. supra n. 9) do not enter, would be permissible under all conditions and would not come under the category of ‘legal adjudication’ (דינא). Hence, the principle ‘a man may take the law etc.,’ would not be applicable in such a case. For ‘seizure’ (תפיםה) without ‘striking’ (הכאה) is not designated ‘legal adjudication’ (דינא). This is substantiated by B.M. 115a (v. text supra n. 8). The latter text would present difficulties even according to R. Naḥman (needless to say according to R. Judah), for as seen above, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands’ is applicable only where the article is intact and is certainly his (the claimant’s), but what is not specifically his does not come under this principle. Consequently, it may be asked how may the claimant enter the home of the surety etc., to take or seize an article which is not specifically his? However, if we say that seizure without striking is not ‘legal adjudication,’ he may enter the home of the surety even against the latter’s will, for this is not a case of taking the law into his own hands. As far as Ber. 5b (v. text supra n. 14) is concerned the vine twigs were taken by R. Huna not as ‘seizure’ (תפיםה), but rather as ‘payment’ (תשלומין), i.e., not with the intention to go subsequently to law. Hence, Isserles states here, ‘and subsequently he goes down with him to Court,’ i.e., he may seize the pledge on the condition that he have the matter dealt with subsequently by the Court. This entire [foregoing ruling] deals with one individual in conflict with [another] individual, but [in the case of] an individual in conflict with an [entire] community,19 M.K. 17a where it is stated that ‘a scholar may take the law into his own hands where he is certain that it is his’ (v. supra n. 6) although he may not be able to prove this before others. An entire community enjoys the status of a scholar in this respect. This is substantiated by B.B. 24b on the principle that ‘a pot that belongs to two partners is neither warm nor cold,’ i.e., since the opinions of an entire community differ and each townsman would rely upon the other, the Rabbis were lenient with them and gave them the status of a scholar even if the individual townsman would suffer thereby. Furthermore, in the case of an entire community it is difficult to ascertain the matter, since they are all interested parties as in the case of a scholar who cannot ascertain his case before others being occupied with his learning. Consequently, the onus of proof rests upon the defendant. Cf. also B.B. 100a. — [the law is that if] he is one of the townsmen,20e., under the same ruler or government to whom they pay taxes (MaHaRIK Rt. 1). In Rt. 2, MaHaRIK states the reverse, viz., that even with respect to an individual who is not one of the townsman, the members of the community are also regarded as ‘actual possessors’ (מוחזקים). It is for this reason that Isserles does not state the law regarding one who is not a member of the community, for it seems that he is doubtful regarding this matter — M.E. ShaK, however, writes that the townmen may take the law into their own hands only with respect to a member of their own community who is in conflict with them, but as far as the townsmen are concerned they are regarded as ‘actual possesors’ even with regards to one who is not a member of their community. , P.Tesh. for conflicting views in this matter. Also with respect to a pledge that has to be given by the individual to the community (v. Gloss anon) before going to Court, the law is that there is no difference between an individual from the same town or not — W.G. they may take the law into their own hands in order to safeguard their interests, [provided] if they know that the law is in their favour, although they are unable to prove [this] before the Court of Law, — for they cannot testify since they are all interested parties in the matter.21RaShBA Resp. 27, s. 95 — G. , § 7, par. 12 and § 37. And if there are differences of opinion and claims between them, — the [members of the] community are called the actual possessors with respect to the individual [who is in conflict with them],22Members of a community are regarded as ‘actual possessors’ only with respect to taxes (v. Gloss anon). Their power is derived from the ruler or governmnt since his security (שעבוד), i.e., that everything stands pledged to the latter, takes precendence over all other securities. This is substantiated by B.B. 55a : ‘If property is purchased by rich landlords (they paid to the government the tax on land, the owners of which were in arrears and thus became the owners of the land) who buy up land from the ruler or his servants and pay the tax on it, the sale is valid. This has reference, however, only to (land) which is transferred to the rich landlords because of the land tax, but if on account of the poll tax, then a purchase from them is not valid, because the poll tax is a personal liability. R. Huna, the son of R. Joshua said that even barley in the pot is seizable for the poll tax. R. Ashi said: Huna b. Nathan told me that Amram found that this view is untenable because if it were so, it would interfere with the law of the double portion to which a firstborn is entitled in the case of an inheritance (Deut. XXI, 17), for all the (inherited) property would thus become ‘prospective’ (since all the property was seizable by the government on account of the poll tax) and (the law is that) a firstborn does not receive a double portion in prospective as in actual assets.’ The Gemara concludes that the father must have paid the land tax prior to his death thereby making his assets actual. Hence, we see that the tax collectors who are authorized by the government are considered ‘actual possessors’ (מוחזקים). , Tosaf. ibid. s.v. אם כן. Thus also according to Yeb. 46a and Tosaf. s.v. כי נפקי. Consequently, the townsmen may say to the individual, ‘Prove your case because it is the claimant that must produce evidence’ (המוציא מחבירו עליו הראיה). And if he cannot produce evidence, they take an oath and are exempt, or if they wish, the individual takes the oath. However, the choice is in their hands as is the law of an ‘actual possesor’ (מוחזק). and he is required to give them a pledge before they go down with him to Court.23Mord. to B.B. VI and II end — G. Derived from B.B. 24b: ‘Trees must be kept away a distance of twenty-five cubits from a town … If the tree was there first, it is cut down but compensation must be given (Mishna). Gemara: Why cannot the owner of the tree say, Compensate me first and I will then cut it down? … A pot with two cooks is neither hot nor cold’ (i.e., each townsman will wait for some other to compensate as a result of which the tree will still remain). Similarly, in the present case, the pledge must be given by the individual to the townsmen and the former becomes the claimant, otherwise the matter will be neglected. The fact that they are called actual possessors with respect to an individual applies only in matters of taxes but not in other cases.24B.B. 24b: In the case of the tree which must be kept away from a town a distance of twenty-five feet cubits (v. previous note), the Mishna states that ‘if the town was there first, the tree is cut down (by the townsmen) and no compensation is given. If the tree was there first, it is cut down and compensation is given. If there is a doubt which was there first, it is cut down and no compensation is given. Gemara asks : Why in the case of pit (ibid. 25b) is it stated that (in the case of a doubt whether the pit or the tree was there first) the tree is not cut down? — With respect to pit it is stated that if the tree was certainly (there first) it is not cut down (contrary to the case of the tree that was there before the town was founded). Consequently, when there is a doubt we also do not say to him, Cut it down. However, in the present case even if the tree was there first it is cut down, consequently, if there is a doubt we also say to him, Cut it down. And should the question of compensation arise, we say to him, Produce evidence that it is yours (i.e., that the tree was there first) and take compensation.’ It follows therefrom that the fundamental reason for cutting down the tree in the case of doubt and not giving compensation is because it is obligatory to remove the tree and since we rule that even if it is certain that the tree was there first, it is cut down, consequently, the doubt remains only regarding the compensation and the townsmen are regarded as the ‘actual possessors.’ Hence, only with respect to monetary matters do they enjoy the status of ‘actual possessors,’ being empowered by the ruler or the government, but not in other matters. Nevertheless, he must give [them] a pledge before they go down to Court with him.25Terumath ha-Deshen s. 341 — G. The pledge must be given by the individual even in a case where the community does not enjoy the status of a possessor, so that the individual should be the claimant.  supra n. 23. This entire [foregoing ruling applies only] where the individual [who is in conflict with the community] is not a scholar, but if he is a scholar where the [study of the] Torah is his [sole] profession and he has a claim in this [matter] on account of taxes, he is not required to give them a pledge and they too are not called actual possessors with respect to him.26R. Menaḥem of Merseburg — G. B.B. 8a deals with scholars who are exempt from the burden of taxes and imposts and ibid. 7b it is considered a transgression against the Holy Writings to collect taxes from them. It follows, therefore, that even if the townsmen have a claim against a student of the Torah, they are not regarded as ‘actual possessors’ for a scholar is released Biblically from the ruler’s obligation. It is permissible to compel [an individual to comply] with [the laws pertaining to] matters of taxes by means of a heathen Court and to cause him to suffer a loss if they cannot collect from him the tax otherwise.27MaHaRIK Rt. 17 and 27 — G.  Git. 88b. Cf. supra § 2, n. 10.",

This is included among the optional secular acts (רשות) enumerated ibid. (An optional secular act refers to one that involves somewhat of a religious act). Explained ibid. 37a: ‘It is a preventive measure lest he write,’ i.e., the arguments and the decision (פםק דין). , O.H. § 339, 4; § 524,  Thus also Yad, Shabbath XXIII, 14. The members of the Beth Din should be careful not to assemble on the Sabbath in the locale where they ordinarily conduct legal proceedings during weekdays lest it should appear that they are sitting in judgment (v. San. 88b where it is stated that on Sabbaths and Festivals the Great Sanhedrin did not meet in the Hall of Hewn stones but rather in the Ḥel. Cf. Ba’er Heteb to O.Ḥ. § 339, n. 3) — P.Tesh. However, if this locale is also used as a meeting place for those who occupy themselves with the needs of the community, it is permissible, — for the law is that one is permitted to devote himself to communal needs on the Sabbath (O.Ḥ. § 306). On Ḥol ha-Moed it is permissible to hold judicial sessions and to put the decision down in writing (O.Ḥ. § 545, 5) — A.H.

    "text_en": "[Civil suits] are not tried on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a Festival.3Y. San. IV, 7(22b) ; Y. Beẓ. V, 2(63a); Y. Ket. I, 1(24d) where it is stated that the Mishna in San. 32a: ‘Capital cases are not tried on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival’ (since in case of condemnation the verdict must be carried out on the following day which is impossible were the trial to be held on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival. Moreover, it would be against the law to leave judgment in suspense until after the Sabbath or Festival — San. 35a. Cf. M.K. 14b) implies that civil suits may be tried on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival. Hence, Caro’s ruling presents a difficulty. Y. (ibid.) therefore, explains that the prohibition against adjudication of civil suits on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival is merely a Rabbinical measure. Thus also Yad, Sanhedrin XI, 3; Alfasi and Asheri to San. ibid. Even if the litigants agreed to appear before the Judges on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival, the prohibition still stands. For the Judges must be deliberate in judgment and since they are busy preparing for the Sabbath or Festival, this is not possible (contra ‘Ir Shushan who writes that the reason is that the people are busy making the festive preparations and should therefore, not be summoned then). This is substantiated by Isserles’ Gloss (anon), ‘but where a prohibition is involved (e.g., divorce or Ḥalizah proceedings) the lenient view should not be adopted’ and in D.M., Isserles adds, ‘for they (the Judges) are busy with the Sabbath preparations and cannot be deliberate in judgment.’ Thus we see that it is on account of the preoccupation of the Judges. This applies only to adjudication, but as regards hearing the pleas of the litigants and issuing the verdict after the Sabbath or Festival, it would be permissible from the Judges’ standpoint to meet for this purpose on the eve of the Sabbath or Festival (Thus RaN to Ket. beg.). The litigants, however, cannot be compelled to appear. This is the meaning of the following statement of Caro, ‘If they summoned a litigant to appear . . he is not obliged to come,’ i.e., even if the summons was for the purpose of hearing the pleas only, or it may mean that even if the Judges are free (e.g., others make the festive preparations for them), yet, the litigants cannot be compelled to appear — M.E. Nethiboth, however, maintains that if the litigants are willing to accept the verdict even if it is erroneous, the Judges may try their case even on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival. If they summoned a litigant to appear before the Court of Law [on these days], he is not obliged to come.4B.K. 113a; Yad, Sanhedrin XXV, 9. , end of previous note. Even if they summoned [him on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival] to appear after the Sabbath or Festival, and he did not come, we do not penalize him.5B.K. ibid. For he may offer the reason that he was busy preparing for the Sabbath or the Festival and did not take notice of the summons (Gemara ibid.) — M.E., ShaK. Gloss: There is an authority who writes that nowadays we may conduct legal proceedings on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a Festival on account of the neglect of [Torah instruction by] teachers.6For throughout the week if they should have to appear in Court, the study of the Torah would be neglected. Hence, on the eve of the Sabbath or Festival when they are free from teaching, it is their only opportunity to appear in Court, if necessary. Hence, if the Beth Din finds it necessary to adjudicate cases on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival, it is permissible. A substantiation for this leniency may be derived from the following Mishna San. 24a: ‘If one (of the contesting parties) said to the other: I accept my father or your father as trustworthy (to act as a Judge), or I accept three herdsmen as trustworthy, R. Meir says, He may (subsequently) retract; but the Sages say, He cannot retract.’ The law is in accord with the Sages, viz., that he cannot retract. It follows therefrom that no prohibition exists against a Beth Din which is Biblically ineligible to adjudicate the case, provided the litigants agreed to accept the ineligible Judges. This applies, of course, to a community where no eligible Judges are available, and such a Beth Din is valid under the circumstances (v. infra § 8, 1; § 22, 1). This is binding only in civil lawsuits, but not where a prohibition is involved. Hence, the ruling of Isserles anon — W.G. (in accord with interpretation of Be’er Eliyahu). And only with respect to a monetary lawsuit may we adopt this lenient view, — for an expropriation made by the Court is valid,7Even if the Judges erred because they could not be deliberate in their judgment — M.E. but where a prohibition [is involved], the lenient view should not be adopted.8Terumath ha-Deshen s. 227 and Hag. SeMaK — G. , supra n. 3. ‘A prohibition’ refers to divorce proceedings or the performance of the Ḥaliẓah ceremony which requires extremely conscientious deliberation. In the case of an emergency (שעת הדחק), the lenient view may be adopted. Cf. E.H. § 154 and § 169. And it seems to me that [this applies] only to [a Court of] a temporary nature [that meets but] occasionally, but we do not establish a Court [for the purpose of meeting] permanently9Where the days are fixed and the Judges come of their own accord. on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a Festival. Thus is the accepted practice. We do not fix a date [that a judicial session be held] during Nisan and Tishri10B.K. 113a. e., until after the Festival because one is then busy on account of the Holidays (according to Rashi because it is the agricultural season). But after the Festival a date may be fixed. The reason mentioned supra n. 5 does not apply here since there was ample time for him to take notice of the summons. Thus Isserles anon — ShaK. In the month of Sivan it would be permissible to summon one to Court because Shabuoth which occurs in this month consists only of two days in the Diaspora (and one day in the Land of Israel) and the question of preoccupation does not apply. On the eve of Shabuoth it would still be forbidden for the reasons stated above — M.E. Some authorities, contra ShaK, forbid the entire months of Nisan and Tishri. There are twenty-one days during which a Groom should not be summoned to appear in Court, viz., seven days prior to the wedding; the seven days of the wedding-feast; seven days following the wedding-feast. Other authorities hold that a Groom should not be summoned only three days before and seven days after the wedding. A widower who marries a widow is not to be summoned during the three days after the marriage (E.H. § 64). In other cases of religious duties, e.g., a circumcision, the Sandek or the father of the child, should they have to appear in Court, the days to be fixed for the hearing should be left to the discretion of the Judges — P.Tesh. for one who is not [a resident] in town, to appear for trial;11But a resident in the same town may be judged. Thus Tur on the authority of Mord., whence we infer that if the contending parties agree to appear for trial from another town, they may be judged throughout the month of Nisan or Tishri (except on the eve of the Festival) — M.E. The opinion of Tur. and Mord. is substantiated by M.K. 14b where it is taught (derived from Tosef. M.K. II, 11) that monetary cases are dealt with by the Courts during Ḥol ha-Moed. This refers to a litigant who lives in the same town and consequently, may be tried even against his will. B.K. 113a, the source of Caro’s ruling deals with a litigant who came from another town. but if they summoned [him] during Nisan and Tishri to appear later, he is penalized if he does not come.12B.K. ibid. Gloss: Some say that suit should not be brought in the Synagogue during Nisan or the High Holy Days even against villagers who came to the Minyan [to pray], but we may [then] fix for them a date [to appear] after the Festival,13 Tur and Sh. ‘Ar. O.Ḥ. § 546, 11: ‘One is permitted to bring charges (against his fellow) on account of debts (owing to him) on Ḥol ha-Moed.’ Thus Caro. But Isserles does not make any comment (ibid.) as in the present ruling, although Mord. is the source of the ruling in O.Ḥ. too. It is quite possible that Caro in O.Ḥ. is dealing with a case where it is permissible to bring charges in the month of Nisan, e.g., where the accused was one of the townsmen or there was deliberate postponement and deception on the part of the accused party, in which case as stated here, it is permissible. Hence, in O.Ḥ. under the above conditions, it is not forbidden to bring charges — M.E. This interpretation is questioned by Ba’er Heteb a.l., for Isserles states here that even villagers who came from out of town are not to be tried whence we infer that much more so in the case of residents is this forbidden. M.E. may, however, be defended for in O.Ḥ. § 539, 3 Isserles does comment, viz., ‘He is permitted to bring charges (against his fellow) in (the place of) judgment on account of his debts.’ M.Abr. rejects the interpretation of M.E., for in O.Ḥ. we deal with bringing charges before a heathen Court, which is permissible during the Festival. This is what is meant by the term משפט (‘in the place of judgment’) employed in O.Ḥ. M.E. is defended by Shebuth Ya‘akob because M.E. refers to § 546 where Caro states the law without using the term משפט (‘in the place of judgment’), i.e., even before a Jewish Court. Maḥaẓith ha-Shekel and Peri Megadim defend M.Abr. for in O.Ḥ. § 546 too, the source is Mord. Tummim makes the following distinction: In the present ruling we deal with a case of one who not only brings charges against his fellow but also, demands that the matter be adjudicated, which is forbidden during this period; whereas in O.Ḥ. we deal with a case where the plaintiff demands payment and refers to a matter which is not contested by the accused party. Hence, it is permissible to be done on Ḥol ha-Moed — P.Tesh. and if we [are able to detect that] there is [deliberate] postponement and deception [on the part of the summoned party in order to avoid justice], we may adjudicate [the matter] forthwith.14Mord. to B.K. X beg. and Hag. Maim. — G. B.K. 113a: ‘R. Naḥman said: We never summon the participants of the Kallah (the assembly of Babylonian students in the months of Elul and Adar) to appear in Court during the period of the Kallah or the participants of the Festival sessions which are held during the festive season (which begins thirty days prior to the Festival). When plaintiffs would come before R. Naḥman (and requested that summonses be issued during this season) he would say to them: Have I assembled them for your individual benefit? But now that there are impostors (who take advantage of this privilege) there is apprehension (that they came to the assemblies for the sake of avoiding justice) !’ The last part of this statement, ‘and now that there are impostors’ is explained by Mord. to mean that we investigate the matter in order to determine whether there is a deliberate postponement or deception on their part in order to avoid justice. Hence, if we discover that this is really the case, we do fix a date for them to appear in Court during the Kallah and the festive sessions. There are some localities where the adopted custom is that if they had begun to adjudicate [the matter] before Nisan and Tishri, we may fix a date [for the continuation of the hearing] even therein,15e., during Nisan and Tishri. Although according to the reasons mentioned above for not summoning one to a judicial session during Nisan or Tishri there is actually no difference between the commencement of the trial or the conclusion thereof, yet, there is support for the custom mentioned here, in Mishna Shab. 9a: ‘If they began, they need not interrupt.’ Cf. also anon: ‘We do not try cases at night … but if they had begun to try monetary cases during the day, they may conclude at night.’ and wherever such is the custom it may be practiced.16Decisions of Isserlein s. 207 — G. We do not try cases at night with respect to the commencement of the trial, but if they had begun to try monetary cases during the day, they may conclude at night.17Mishna San. 32a. Gemara (ibid. 34b) : ‘Whence is this derived? R. Ḥiyya b. Papa said: From the verse, And let them judge the people at all times (Ex. XVIII, 22 i.e., even at night). If this is the case, then even the commencement of the trial may (be held at night) — It is as Raba expounded. For Raba pointed out an incongruity (between two verses) : It is written, And let them judge the people at all times (ibid.); but elsewhere it is written, And in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit (Deut. XXI, 16. Here day is emphasized whence it follows that not only cases of inheritance must be decided by day but likewise all civil claims. Hence, this verse contradicts the preceding one). How now is this (reconciled)? — The day is for the commencement of the trial, the night for the conclusion of the trial’ (for, and they shall judge … at all times implies rendering judgment which is the essential factor). In Resp. of Isserles he writes that if the contesting parties agreed to be judged at night, it is permissible to do so, for this should not be regarded different from a case where the litigants accepted as Judge a relative or one who is ineligible. For this reason we adopt the lenient practice nowadays to judge at night, for when the parties appear for trial and come willingly, it is regarded as though they accepted him. Hence, the proceedings may be held at night. Thus M.E. P.Tesh cites dissenting opinions. Caro’s ruling that ‘they may conclude at night’ has reference to cases where there was not enough time to complete the proceedings during the day — P.Tesh. Some say that if they violated [this ruling] and tried cases at night [even with respect to the commencement of the trial], their decision holds good.18RaShBaM (to B.B. 114a, s.v. אפילו) — G. Derived from Y. San. IV, 6(22b). Tosaf. Yeb. 103b, s.v. מר םכר emends text of Y., whence it follows that only the conclusion of the trial may be held at night but not the commencement of the trial. Hence, emended text of Y. according to Tosaf. corresponds to Babli San. 34b (v. supra n. 17). Cf. infra § 28, 24; San. 11b: The sanctification of the month must take place during the day. This is based on the verse, For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the G-d of Jacob. Thus we see that the sanctification of the month is equated to Judgment which is executed during the day. ShaK rules, contra the present ruling that if the entire legal proceedings were conducted at night, the decision is not valid.",

    "text_en": "The time when Judges sit [in judgment] is from the morning until the end of the fifth hour.19Shab. 10a: ‘Until when do they sit in judgment? — R. Shesheth said until mealtime. R. Ḥama said, Which Biblical verse (teaches this) ? — For it is written, Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! Happy art thou O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength and not for drunkenness! (Eccl. X, 16f) [i.e.,] in the strength of the Torah and not in the drinking of wine.’ (‘Princes’ are taken here as ‘Judges’ who first sit in judgment and then have their meal). Ibid.: ‘The sixth hour is the mealtime for scholars.’ , also O.Ḥ. § 157. Tur writes, ‘until mid-day’ and Maim. (Yad, Sanhedrin III, 1) states, ‘until the end of the sixth hour.’ Caro in B.Yos. states that this is incorrect, for the sixth hour is the mealtime for scholars and ‘after that it is like throwing a stone into a leather bottle’ (Gemara ibid.), i.e., it has no effect or is indigestible. Caro in the present ruling follows Alfasi and Asheri to San.  It is quite likely that both Tur and Maim. in using the expression ‘until’ may mean ‘exclusive of’ (עד ולא עד בכלל) i.e., close to midday or close to the end of the sixth hour, so that the mealtime begins for the Judges before the sixth hour is over and is extended into the seventh hour. Eating something before the end of the sixth hour would be equivalent to partaking of something in the morning in which case it matters not if the main meal is postponed (v. Gemara ibid.) — M.E., BaḤ, ShaK. Cf. Kesef Mishneh to Yad ibid. According to Zohar, Mishpatim 122a, one must not sit in judgment after partaking of a meal. Derived from Execute justice in the morning (Jer. XX, 12) and Ye shall not eat with the blood (Lev. XIX, 26). Cf. however, M.K. 14b. Tur at the head of this chapter adds, that originally it was enacted by Ezra, the Scribe, that Courts hold their sessions on Mondays and Thursdays (B.K. 82a) for then people were present since they came to read the Torah. Today, however, all days are similar. Hence, this was not mentioned by Caro — M.E. From that time onward they are not obliged to sit.20Derived from Shab. ibid. ‘R. Ammi and R. Assi were sitting and studying between the columns (of the study-house). From time to time they would knock at the side of the door and say: If there is anyone who has a lawsuit, let him enter and come in. R. Ḥisda and Rabbah, son of R. Huna were sitting in judgment all day and their hearts grew faint (Rashi: they were distressed at not being able to study. Or because they were famished), (whereupon) R. Ḥiyya b. Rab of Difta expounded to them, and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening (Ex. XVIII, 13) ; Can it really enter your mind that Moses sat and judged the entire day? When was his learning done? But this teaches you, Every Judge who judges in complete truth even for one hour, the Bible text credits him as though he had become a partner to the Holy One, blessed be He, in the act of creation. Here it is written, and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening, and elsewhere it is written, and there was morning and there was evening one day (Gen. I, 5).’ According to Rashi’s second interpretation they were not obliged to sit and judge throughout the entire day.",

    "text_en": "They [the Judges] do not sit in judgment from the beginning of the seventh hour even to conclude the trial until they recite the [major] Minḥa service.21Mishna Shab. 9b in accord with R. Aḥa b. Jacob (Gemara ibid.) who explains that this has reference even to the conclusion of the trial (גמר דין) where the pleas of the litigants have already been heard, for the Judges may discover an argument in order to reverse the judgment which will necessitate hearing the pleas afresh and will thereby forget to recite the Minḥa service. Thus also Yad, Tefillah VI, 5. According to Rashi ibid. s.v. מנחה גדולה, the major Minḥa begins from six and a half hours and onwards (assuming that the day begins at 6:00 a.m. and ends at 6:00 p.m. An ‘hour’ means a twelfth part of the day), i.e., from 12:30 p.m. The expression ‘close to’ (סמוך) used in Mishna ibid. means half an hour before the appointed time. This is derived from Pes. 99b where סמוך למנחה (close to Minḥa) refers to one half hour before the minor Minḥa. Hence, the same applies to the major Minḥa which begins from six and half hours and onwards. Cf. also ibid 100b and v. Ber. 26b: ‘Which is the major Minḥa? — From six hours and a half onwards. Which is the minor Minḥa? — From nine hours and a half and onwards,’ i.e., from 3:30 onwards. Consequently, we do not sit in judgment from the beginning of the seventh hour. Legally the beginning of the seventh hour (12 noon) is the time for reciting Minḥa (v. O.Ḥ. § 232, 2), only that the Sages ordained to wait an additional half an hour in order to make certain that the sun is beginning to decline, for otherwise one may err with respect to the end of the sixth and the beginning of the seventh hour — M.E. However, if they began, even the commencement of the trial, they need not interrupt,22Mishna Shab. ibid. Just as ‘in the first instance’ no distinction is made between the beginning of the trial (תחלת דין) and the conclusion of the trial (גמר דין), so too, if they had already begun, no such distinction is made. For in a sense the ‘conclusion of the trial’ is also a commencement, since the judges must reorientate themeselves with the facts before concluding, i.e., before giving a verdict. , ibid 9b, Tosaf. s.v. בתספורת and Asheri a.l. even when the time for [reciting] the minor Minḥa had arrived,23Shab. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. ואס; Suk. 36a; Ber. 28b, Tosaf. s.v. כיון; Asheri and other Codifiers. provided they have time to recite the Tefillah after they conclude the trial.24Shab. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. אין מפסיקין; Suk. ibid. But in the first instance it is forbidden lest the case be prolonged and they forget to recite the Minḥa service — M.E. If they sat down in judgment close to the minor Minḥa, they must interrupt [their deliberations].25Tur — G. Even if they began the ‘conclusion of the trial’ (v. supra n. 22). Later Codifiers write that nowadays we adopt a leniency in this matter because the time for Minḥa services is usually announced and there is no apprehension lest they forget (Tummim) — A.H.",

For in the case of robbery of less than a Perutah’s worth, it is not considered ‘money’ (Gemara ibid.) — M.E. In the case of a claim of vessels, however, the Court meets even if less than a Perutah’s worth is involved. , infra § 88, 3. Thus also RaN to Sheb. VI, R. Yeruḥam; Maim. Yad, To‘en we-Nit‘an III, 5. Others oppose this view and maintain that even in the case of vessels a Court session meets only when at least a Perutah’s worth is involved, for less than that is not considered ‘money’ — ShaK. Tummim states that Shitah Mekubeẓeth writes on the authority of RITBA (to B.M. ibid.) that if the claim concerns an object that is still extant, a Court session may meet for this purpose, even if it involves a claim of less than a Perutah’s worth. It is only when payment is demanded that it must involve at least a Perutah’s worth. In the case of two partners who have a claim against an individual in the amount of a Perutah, the law is that although the claim involves only half a Perutah with respect to each partner, yet, since the claim of the partners as a whole involves at least a Perutah’s worth, we may hold a Court session therefor. This would not apply to two individuals (not partners) who together have a claim of a Perutah’s worth against the same party — P.Tesh., A.H. If one person has a claim of a Perutah’s worth against two people, a judicial session may be held therefor, since with respect to the plaintiff the claim is regarded as ‘money’ — A.H. If the Court held a session for a claim that involved less than a Perutah’s worth, such Court has the jurisdiction of a Beth Din insofar as admissions made in their presence are considered binding. Likewise with respect to one who was found to be a liar at such a session, the law is that he remains under such presumption — Nethiboth. However, if they met [on account of a claim of] a Perutah's worth, they may conclude their trial even for [a claim] less than a Perutah's worth.2Tur citing Maim. Yad, Sanhedrin XX, 11 in accord with R. Kattina (B.M. ibid.): ‘The above text states: R. Kattina said: The Court holds sessions even for less than a Perutah’s worth. Raba raised an objection: And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing (Lev. V, 16), this (redundant and) extends the law of making amends even to less than a Perutah’s worth. Hence, it applies only to Hekdesh but not to Ḥullin! (i.e., only in the case of sacred objects amends should be made even regarding less than a Perutah’s worth, but not in secular objects. In the latter case one may be compelled to restore aught that involves at least a Perutah’s worth) — But if it was said, it was said thus: R. Kattina stated, If the Court met for a claim of a Perutah’s worth, they may conclude (the case) even for less (i.e., if for some reason the claim was reduced to less than a Perutah’s worth), (because) at the commencement of the trial a Perutah must be involved, but at the conclusion a (claim of a) Perutah’s worth is not necessary.’ This latter statement viz., that ‘at the commencement of the trial … not necessary,’ should be understood as follows: Even if the defendant after the verdict is rendered puts forth a claim against the plaintiff which involves less than a Perutah’s worth, the Judges may conclude the trial even for this amount, the reason being that it is all regarded as one trial, for if the defendant is legally proven to be justified in his claim, he may deduct whatever is owing to him from the plaintiff’s claim. Thus Rashi ibid. and Kesef Mishneh to Yad ibid. It is for this reason that Caro in the present ruling states, ‘and they may conclude their trial,’ whereas Maim. ibid. has ‘and they may conclude his trial’ — M.E. , B.M. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. ותנא דידן; W.G. and Be’er Eliyahu a.l. M.E. adopts the ruling of Asheri contra Maim., that even if they hold a session for a Perutah’s worth, they may not conclude the proceedings for less than a Perutah’s worth. If for some reason the plaintiff’s original claim is reduced to less than a Perutah and at the conclusion of the trial the plaintiff puts forth another claim of less than a Perutah’s worth, according to some, even Asheri will hold that the trial may be concluded, because both claims are combined. BaḤ, however, disagrees with this — P.Tesh.",

Derived from Yeb. 102a: ‘Raba said: A proselyte may judge a fellow proselyte according to Biblical law, for it is said, Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the Lord thy G-d shall choose, one from among thy bretheren, shalt thou set king over thee (Deut. XVII, 15. ‘King’ is taken to mean also ‘Judge.’  Prov. XXIX, 4); only when set over thee must he be one from among thy brethren, but a proselyte may judge his fellow proselyte.’ Rashi explains this passage as referring to capital cases, for as far as civil suits are concerned, a proselyte may judge even Israelites according to Mishna San. 32a: ‘All are eligible to judge civil suits’ which is explained in Gemara ibid. 36b: ‘All includes a proselyte.’ Tosaf. (Yeb. 45b, s.v. כיון) however, maintain that the passage in Yeb. 102a refers to civil suits (i.e., if his mother was not an Israelitish woman he may judge only a fellow proselyte in civil suits but not an Israelite), and as to the text in San. ibid. it refers to a proselyte who judges a fellow proselyte only. Alfasi and Asheri write that in San. we deal with a proselyte whose mother was an Israelitish woman. Caro’s present ruling, viz., that even if one of the members of the Beth Din is a proselyte, the Court is unfit to judge an Israelite, is derived from Yeb. 101b: ‘R. Samuel b. Judah was once standing before Rab Judah when the latter said to him, Come up to this bundle of reeds (a place designated for a Ḥaliẓah ceremony) to be counted in the number of five (judges at the Ḥaliẓah ceremony) so that the matter be publicized well (i.e., in order that it become known that she is a Ḥaluẓah and forbidden to a Kohen). We have learned, the first said, In Israel (Deut. XXVI, 10) means at a Court of Israelites, but not at a Court of proselytes, and I am a proselyte.’ This shows that even if one of the members of the Court is a proselyte, it is unfit to judge. Even the children’s children of a proselyte are ineligible to judge Israelites — M.E. unless his2The proselyte’s. mother3Yeb. 102a: ‘If his mother was an Israelitish woman (i.e., even if his father is non-Jewish — R.A.Eger) he may judge even an Israelite.’ For then the proselyte is considered one from among thy brethren. , Yeb. 45a and Tosaf. s.v. כיון. Likewise three proselytes whose mothers were Israelitish women may act as Judges of a Beth Din even for Israelites (D.M., B.Yos.) — M.E. or his2The proselyte’s. father4Mord. on the authority of Tosaf. (Yeb. 102a, s.v. (לענין חליצה) — G. Cf. Kid. 77a. If his father alone was an Israelite (and his mother was a proselyte — R.A.Eger) it goes without saying that the proselyte may judge a fellow Israelite — M.E. were Israelitish. A proselyte may, however, judge his fellow proselyte5e., a real proselyte; but if he was conceived and born in a hallowed condition (his mother became a Jewess before conception), he is regarded as a genuine Israelite, in which case the Judge must be the issue of an Israelitish woman (v. Yeb. 102a, Tosaf. s.v. לענין חליצה and ibid. 98a, Tosaf. s.v. נשא). But as far as the proselyte Judge is concerned even if he was conceived and born in a hallowed condition, he may not judge a fellow-Israelite — R.A. Eger, P.Tesh. although his2The proselyte’s. mother is not an Israelitish woman.6 Y.D. § 269 — G. Cf. supra n.  D.M. writes on the authority of Mord. that a proselyte may judge another proselyte only with the latter’s consent. M.E. states that he has not found this implication in Mord. nor in Asheri, but the law is (in accordance with Y.D. § 269 end) that a proselyte may judge a fellow proselyte even through compulsion and if the litigant agrees to be tried before a proselyte Judge, the latter may judge even an Israelite. Thus also BaḤ and ShaK.",

    "text_en": "[A Judge who genealogically is] a bastard7Heb. ממזר. On the meaning of this term, v. Mishna Yeb. IV, 13 and E.H. § 4, 13. and even if the three of them [who comprise the Court] are bastards, they are eligible to act as Judges8San. 36b: Mishna: ‘All are fit to try civil suits.’ Gemara: ‘What does all include? — It is meant to include a bastard. Have we not already learnt this before (Nid. 49b), Whoever is fit to try capital cases is also fit to try civil suits. However, there are some who are fit to try civil suits but not capital cases … One was intended to include a proselyte, the other a bastard.’ , supra n. 1. Just as a proselyte may try a fellow-proselyte even if he has to compel the latter to appear before him for trial (v. supra n. 6), so too, in the case of a bastard-Judge. This is derived from Mishna San. 32a: ‘All are fit to try civil suits, but not all are fit to try capital cases,’ which means that as in the case of capital charges, compulsion may be used, so too, in the case of civil suits, the bastard-Judge may use compulsion — Be’er Eliyahu. Caro’s ruling that even if the entire Beth Din is comprised of bastard-Judges they are considered fit to judge, is derived from the expression (San. ibid.) ‘all (הכל) are eligible,’ which is meant to include not only if one of the Judges was a bastard, but even if an entire Court of three consists of bastard-Judges, they are eligible to act as Judges. Thus also Yad, Sanhedrin II, 9. , also Kid. 76b, where it is stated that Judges may be appointed of genealogically ineligible persons save in Jerusalem where only Judges of pure descent were appointed. for everyone.9e., even for legitimate Israelites. Not as in the case of a proselyte who may judge only a fellow-proselyte if the former’s mother was not an Israelitish woman. The bastard-Judge may try even Israelites. This is deduced from Kid. ibid. according to the interpretation of San. 36b. Tosaf. s.v. חדא. For contrary to the proselyte whose mother was not an Israelitish woman and consequently may only judge a fellow-proselyte, the bastard is of Jewish ancestry. Thus also if each one of them was blind in one of his eyes, he is eligible [to act as Judge].10Thus Yad ibid.; N; Ba‘al ha-Maor; R. Sherira Gaon a.o. This refers even to the ‘commencement of a trial.’ Alfasi and Asheri state the reason as follows: Since all other people may conclude the trial by night and the eyesight of one blind in one eye is better by day, consequently, the latter may judge even at the commencement of the trial (M.E.), even ‘in the first instance.’ For if this applies only to the conclusion of the trial, how can there be a conclusion without a commencement of the trial — Lebush and Tummim. Here too, it refers to both one Judge or three Judges blind in one eye — A.H. , supra nn. 6 and 8. The present ruling is derived from San. 34b; Nid. 49b-50a: ‘Our Mishna (that a decision may be given at night) disagrees with R. Meir. For it has been taught, R. Meir would say, What is the meaning of the verse, According to their word shall every controversy and every leprosy be (Deut. XXI, 5) ? What connection is there between controversies and leprosies? Controversies are compared to leprosies: just as leprosies must be examined by day, since it is written, And in the day when raw flesh appeareth in him (Lev. XIII, 14) so must controversies be tried by day; and as leprosies are not to be examined by the blind (even in one eye, v. Neg. II, 3), for it is written, Wherever the priest looketh (ibid. v. 12), so controversies also may not be tried by a blind man (even in one eye only — Yad Ramah) … A blind man who lived in the neighbourhood of R. Joḥanan used to try civil suits and R. Joḥanan raised no objection against it. But how could he (R. Joḥanan) act so (to permit him to judge) ? Did not R. Joḥanan actually say, The Halakah agrees with an anonymous Mishna, and we have learnt (the following anonymous Mishna) : Whoever is fit to judge is eligible to testify. However, one may be fit to testify but not eligible to judge, and R. Joḥanan said that this includes one who is blind in one eye (consequently, R. Joḥanan should have objected to the blind man who acted as Judge) ? — R. Joḥanan found another anonymous Mishna (according to which a blind man may judge): Civil suits must be tried by day and may be concluded by night (San. 32a. Hence, according to this Mishna ‘controversies’ were not assimilated to ‘leprosies.’ Consequently, they were not compared with respect to the unfitness of a blind man either, since there are many whose eyesight is as dim by night as a blind man during the day and yet, it states that they may conclude the trial by night). Why is this anonymous Mishna (San.) preferable to the other (Nid.) ? — If you wish I might say, An anonymous Mishna which expresses the view of the majority is preferable (in Nid. the individual opinion of R. Meir is given; in San. that of the majority of the Rabbis), and if you wish I might reply that it (San.) was taught in the tractate dealing with legal procedure (whereas in Nid. it is cited only incidentally).’ However, one who is blind in both his eyes is ineligible [to act as Judge].11Thus Yad ibid. For only in the case of one blind in one eye is it permissible, whence it follows that one blind in both eyes is unfit to judge, since everyone agrees that it is forbidden to try cases at night (v. supra § 5, 2) and for one blind in both eyes the day too, is like night for him — M.E. ‘Ir Shushan deduces the prohibition against one blind in both eyes from the comparison made between ‘controversies’ and ‘leprosies’ (v. text supra n. 10). This is rejected by M.E., for in San. and Nid. ibid. it was explained that this represents an individual opinion (R. Meir). Furthermore, on this principle, even one blind in one eye would be ineligible. W.G. writes contra M.E. that the eligibility of one blind in one eye is not on account of the comparison with ‘night’ during which a trial may be concluded, for then one blind in both eyes should be fit to judge, but it is rather derived from the general rule in the first part of the Mishna (Nid. ibid.), viz., ‘Whosoever is fit to judge is fit to testify,’ and since one blind in both eyes is ineligible to offer testimony, he is likewise unfit to judge. According to M.E. (who follows Alfasi and Asheri), a Judge whose eyesight was unimpaired at the commencement of the trial and before the trial was concluded became blind, would be eligible to judge at the conclusion of the trial (v. supra); whereas, according to ‘Ir Shushan who compares ‘controversies’ to ‘leprosies,’ he would be ineligible — P.Tesh. An actual case is reported in Keneseth Ezekiel where the litigants were tried by three Judges and after the pleas were heard and the testimony was offered, one of the Judges accidentally became blind in both eyes, whereupon one of the litigants objected to the participation of the blind Judge in the conclusion of the trial. Keneseth Ezekiel after stating the views of the Codifiers, viz., a) Maim. — one blind in both eyes is ineligible to judge even at the conclusion of the trial; b) Tosaf., SeMaG and Mord. — eligible even for the commencement of the trial, c) Alfasi — ineligible for the commencement of the trial, eligible for the conclusion, — ruled in accordance with the last opinion (Alfasi). Hence, the Judge in the above case who became blind in both eyes before the conclusion of the trial, is eligible to judge together with the other two judges and give a decision. BaḤ also states that ex post facto (בדיעבד) the decision of one blind in both eyes is valid. Moreover, the above case may be considered as ex post facto, since the pleas and testimony were already heard before the accident happened. In addition it may be said that since three Judges were present, then even if the decision of the now blind Judge is not valid, yet, on the basis of BeHaG and Tosaf. who accept Samuel’s dictum, ‘If two Judges tried a case, their decision holds good’ (San. 2b. Cf. supra § 3, 2), the recalcitrant litigant may be compelled to accept their decision. However, according to Tummim, Nethiboth a.o., even if the Judge became blind at the conclusion of the trial, he is ineligible — P.Tesh. One whose eyesight is very dim but is not blind may act as Judge. According to the majority of the Codifiers who rule that one blind in both eyes is unfit to judge, support for this may also be found in the following passage in Ket. 94b: ‘(R. Joḥanan) said (to R. Shesheth who was totally blind), I am a Judge and the master is no Judge,’ i.e., R. Shesheth had no right to render a decision in a certain case mentioned ibid. Cf. Rashi ibid. — P.Tesh.",

    "text_en": "Some say that one is fit to judge only from the age of eighteen and onwards,12Tur on the authority of ‘some say,’ derived from Shab. 56b: ‘R. Samuel b. Naḥmani said on the authority of R. Jonathan: Whoever says that Josiah sinned is mistaken, for it is written, And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and walked in all the ways of David his father (II Kings XXII, 2). How then do I explain, and like unto him there was no king before him that returned (Shab) to the Lord with all his heart etc., (ibid. XXIII, 25, whence it follows that at first he sinned). This intimates that he reconsidered every decision that he rendered between the ages of eight (the time of his accession to the throne Ibid. v. 1) and eighteen’ (when the Book of the Law was discovered). He thus re-examined (this is the meaning of Shab) his decisions in the light of the Book of the Law discovered by Ḥilkiah (ibid vv. 1-8). ‘Eighteen’ is taken by Rashi to refer to the eighteenth year of his reign. Hence, it has no connection with the age of the King. Some, however, take ‘eighteen’ (and this is followed by Caro in the present ruling) as the age of the King, i.e., when Josiah was eighteen years of age, the Book of the Law was discovered by Ḥilkiah. At the age of eighteen a person is considered a distinguished and conspicuous individual and has the capability to save the poor from the hand of one who would rob him. This is one of the attributes of a Judge (v. Tur a.l.) — M.E. , also Aboth V, 21. and [provided] he has grown two pubic hairs.13Deduced from Mishna Yeb. 96b: ‘It is all one (i.e., with respect to illegal cohabitation) whether he is of the age of nine years and a day or whether he is of the age of twenty years and has not grown two pubic hairs.’ Thus we see that if one has not produced the signs of maturity, he still counts as a minor. Cf. Nid. V, 9. Hence, the present ruling. And some say that from the age of thirteen years [plus one day] and onwards, one is eligible to judge, even if he has not grown two pubic hairs.14Derived from Y. San. IV, 9(22b): ‘R. Abbahu states on the authority of R. Joḥanan: Even one who is less than twenty years old and has not grown two pubic hairs, is eligible to try civil suits but not capital charges.’ Although the age of thirteen is not mentioned in this text, it goes without saying that the Judge must not be less than thirteen years and a day, for only then is one designated an adult. As to the text in Shab. ibid., this viewpoint accepts the interpretation of Rashi (v. n. 12 supra). Cf. also the reading in Shab. ibid., ‘until eighteen’ (עד י״ח). Were ‘until eighteen years of age’ meant the reading should have been עד בן י״ח. , Maharsha a.l. The underlying reason for the second viewpoint is that although with reference to valid testimony it is required that the witnesses possess signs of maturity, deduced from, then both the men between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord (Deut. XIX, 17. This refers to the witnesses and it is obligatory that they be men, i.e., of mature age. , Sheb. 30a; B.B. 155b), this is not the case with respect to a Judge. In the latter case he must possess a reasoning mind and be versed in the intricacies of the Law. But one who is less than thirteen years old, is ineligible to judge, for being a minor he does not come under the category of observing religious duties according to Biblical Law. However, a difficulty presents itself on the basis of the principle, ‘Whoever is fit to judge is eligible to testify’ (Mishna Nid. 49b), which conversely, would mean that ‘whoever is unfit to judge is ineligible to testify.’ Consequently, it follows that according to the first opinion recorded in the present ruling, one who is thirteen years of age and has grown two pubic hairs would be ineligible to testify, and again, according to the second viewpoint, one who is thirteen years of age but has not produced two pubic hairs would be ineligible to judge. This difficulty may be removed on the assumption that the above-mentioned principle was meant to assimilate testimony and adjudication with respect to the minority age of the individual only, for in both cases, a minor, i.e., one less than thirteen years and a day is unfit — M.E. In civil suits involving immovable property (קרקעות), he may not judge until he produces two pubic hairs, for otherwise, his transaction is considered invalid in immovable property ( B.B. 155b; infra § 35, 3; § 235) — Tummim. Mishkenoth Ya‘akob supports the first view recorded in the present ruling, but concludes that a Judge should be appointed when he is at least twenty years old. Shebuth Ya‘akob states that in the case of one who judges alone we should adopt a stringent view and one should not judge before he is forty years old unless there is none other greater than he available in that city (v. Y.D. § 242, 31, Gloss). But with respect to one who is a member of a Court of three, it is permissible for him to judge even before he reaches his fortieth year, for his decision should not be regarded as inferior to that of a Court of three laymen whose decision is binding — P.Tesh. , also P.Tesh. to Y.D. ibid. A.H. writes that the above rulings are only added stringencies, and that according to Biblical Law, it seems that if the individual has grown two pubic hairs and is thirteen years of age plus one day, he may be a Judge. Before he produces the two pubic hairs, his decision is not binding (contra second opinion), for a minor’s act is ineffective.",

XXI, 1), — the Scriptural text places a woman on the same level with a man as regards all the judgments of the law’ (i.e., with respect to civil suits). Tosaf. s.v. אשר raises the question that before them refers only to those who are eligible to judge but not to those who are judged (v. Torah Temimah a.l.). Cf. Git. 88b: ‘before them, but not before laymen,’ and a woman is ineligible to judge, for the Mishna Nid. 49b states that ‘Whoever is fit to judge is fit to testify’ and since a woman is unfit to testify (v. B.K. 88a; Sheb. 30a), it follows that she is unable to judge. Consequently, the above passage that equates man and woman as regards all the judgments of the law refers to woman only from the point of view of being judged in cases where she has monetary claims against another person, but she herself may not act as Judge. As to Deborah, the prophetess concerning whom it is stated that She judged Israel at that time (Judges IV, 4) whence we see that a woman may judge, it may be said that it was permissible only on account of a Divine order, or that she merely taught the Law. But the text serves as no precedent that a woman may judge. , also Y. Yoma VI, 1(43b); Y. Sheb. IV, 1(35b) where it is stated that a woman may not judge because she is ineligible to testify. Cf. also Yad, Melakim I, 5 and RIDBaZ a.l.; Sifre to Shofetim XVII, 15. Although a woman may not judge, nevertheless, a learned woman may instruct law and offer legal directives (cf. supra on Deborah and Sefer ha-Ḥinnuk § 83 and § 152; Sha‘are Teshubah to O.Ḥ. § 461, n. 17 — P.Tesh.",

    "text_en": "Some say that those who are under the influence of wine are permitted to adjudicate civil suits.16Mishna San. 40a: ‘They (the Judges) drink no wine the entire day.’ Gemara ibid. 42a: ‘Why is wine not permitted? — R. Aḥa b. Ḥanina said: The Scriptural text states, It is not for princes to say, Where is strong drink (Prov. XXXI, 4), (i.e.,) those engaged in (solving) the secrets of the world (administration of justice, connecting רוזנים with רז, secret) must abstain from strong drink.’ Tosaf. ibid. s.v. העוסקים write that this refers only to the adjudication of capital charges, but not to civil suits. As to the text in ‘Er. 64a: ‘He who drank a quarter of a Log of wine must not render legal decisions,’ it refers to giving a legal decision in ritual law (איסור והיתר. Cf. the expression אל יורה). , also Yad, Bi’ath ha-Mikdash I, 3; Y.D. § 242, 13, Gloss. The present ruling, viz., that in civil suits one who is under the influence of wine may act as a Judge has reference only to a case where there are two other Judges present who will remind him of the law should he err, but a single Judge or three Judges under the influence of wine should not judge — Tummim, Nethiboth. However, according to Num. R. X, 4, one under the influence of wine may not act as a Judge even in civil suits (cf. the expression אל ידון ibid) which contradicts the present ruling. BaḤ and Shebuth Ya‘akob rule that even in civil suits one under the influence of wine is forbidden to act as Judge. Thus also R. Jonah in Sefer ha-Yir’ah makes no distinction between ritual and civil law. In both cases one under the influence of wine must not act as a Judge — P.Tesh. M.E. writes that since our wines nowadays are diluted, we may adopt a leniency with respect to a Judge who partakes of a quarter of a Log of wine. A witness may not act as a Judge.17Ket. 21a: ‘R. Abba sat and stated this law, that a witness may act as a Judge. R. Safra raised an objection against R. Abba: If three saw it (the new Moon) and they are of the Court (that sanctifies the new moon), two (of them) stand up and set (two) of their fellows (of the Sanhedrin) beside the one (Judge) and they (the two) bear witness before them (the three who constitute the Court) and (then) they may say, It is hallowed! It is hallowed!, — for a single person is not believed by himself. Now, if you entertain the opinion that a witness may act as a Judge, what is all this for? Let them sit in their places (after testifying) and declare (in conjunction with the third person), the new Moon is hallowed! — He (R. Abba) replied: That also presented a difficulty to me, and I asked R. Isaac b. Martha, and R. Isaac (asked) R. Huna, and R. Huna (asked) Ḥiyya b. Rab, and Ḥiyya b. Rab (asked) Rab, and he said to them, Leave alone the testimony regarding the new Moon (because it is) Biblical and the attestation of documents is Rabbinical (In a Biblical matter a witness may not act as a Judge; in the case of a Rabbinic enactment, e.g., the confirmation of documents this does not apply. Cf. Git. 5b).’ B.B. 113b-114a: ‘Rabbah b. Ḥanina taught a Baraitha before R. Naḥman: (It is written,) Then it shall be in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit (Deut. XXI, 16) — (this teaches) that you may make the division of inheritances during the day, but not at night. Abaye said unto him: But according to this (Abaye assumes that the division of an inheritance is made only when the person died in the daytime) would children inherit him who died during the day and not him who died at night? Perhaps you refer to the adjudication of inheritances (which must take place during the day. , supra § 5), for it was taught: (With the Biblical text), but it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment (Num. XXVII, 11), the whole section (Num. ibid. vv. 1-11 on the laws of inheritance) has been proclaimed as of a judicial nature (The judicial procedure of inheritances is equated to that of civil suits in general. Those who are present form a Court of three even if the testator’s natural heirs are opposed to it. Thus Tosaf. who explain that this refers both to a sickbed bequest as well as to one made by a person in good health. , Rashi to San. 34b). And this is in accord with Rab Judah who said: If three (persons) came to visit a sick person, they may, if they so desire (either) write down (his bequest and thus act as witnesses to the document), or issue a judicial verdict (for since they are three they form a laycourt and thus attest to the instructions of the testator and execute the Will). If two (persons came), they may write down (the instructions and act as witnesses to the document), but may not issue a judicial verdict (for since they are less than three they cannot constitute a Court and merely may act as witnesses). R. Ḥisda stated: This applies only to daytime; at night, however, even three (persons) may (only) record (the instructions of the testator and act as witnesses), but may not form a Court (because at night judicial sessions are not held for the commencement of a trial. , supra §. 5). What is the reason? Because (at night) they (merely) become (eligible to act as) witnesses and a witness may not act as a Judge (this means that even on the following day they may not act as Judges in this matter since the instructions were recorded at night and they became qualified to act as witnesses only).’ Cf. San. 34b. Mishna R.H. 25b: ‘If three saw it … It is hallowed’ (v. first part of this note for text). Gemara ibid. 25b-26a: ‘This means that a witness may act as Judge. May we say that our Mishna is not in agreement with R. Akiba, for it has been taught: If the Sanhedrin beheld a man murder a person, some of them act as witnesses and some of them as Judges. This is the opinion of R. Tarfon. R. Akiba says: They all act as witnesses and a witness may not act as a Judge? — You may even say that our Mishna is in agreement with R. Akiba, but R. Akiba stated this only with respect to capital charges, for the All-Merciful commanded, the congregation shall judge … and the congregation shall deliver (Num. XXXV, 25-26), and since they saw him murder a person, they cannot find any defence in his favour. However, in this case, even R. Akiba agrees (that a witness may act as a Judge).’ Cf. B.K. 90b. , also Y. R.H. III, 1(58d); Y. San. I, 2(18c); ibid. V, 5(23a). There are two fundamental reasons why a witness may not act as a Judge: a) Evidence that is given must be liable to refutation by proving an alibi (עדות שיכול להזימה. , supra § 1, n. 40). Hence, if we should say that a witness may act as a Judge, this principle would not be applicable, for the Judge will never accept any refutation against himself; b) It is written, then both the men between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days (Deut. XIX, 17), — Both the men refers to the witnesses; between … is applies to the litigants; before the Lord … judges means that they must stand before the Judges. Hence, if a witness may act as a Judge, this exposition would be impossible. Cf. supra n. 14. , Ket. 21b, Tosaf. s.v. הנח and par. ref. Consequently, if three persons beheld the incident during the day when it is permissible to hold a judicial session, they constitute a Court of three and are not designated as witnesses. Hence, they may act as Judges as stated anon — M.E. [This applies] only [to] a witness who testifies, e.g., if one of the Judges testified18Together with another person — M.E. before his colleagues19e., before a Court of three, for hearing evidence is part of the adjudication which requires three Judges to be present. It means that after one of the Judges rises to testify in conjunction with another lay person, the remaining two Judges co-opt a third person to form a Beth Din of three. Consequently, after giving evidence, the witness may not return to sit with the Judges — M.E. about a [certain] incident which he beheld, he cannot be combined with them to hold a judicial session regarding that incident.20R.H. 25b-26a and parallel passages. , texts supra n. 17; Ket. 21b, Tosaf. s.v. הנח and parallel references. However, if he does not testify, e.g., [in a case] where the three Judges beheld the incident,21Ibid. even if they beheld [the incident] with the express intent to be designated as testimony,21Ibid. — [the law is that] if they beheld it during the day,22At which time they were eligible to act as Judges. , supra § 5, 3. they may act as Judges and may hold a judicial session concerning that incident;23Cf. supra n. 20. A judicial session may be held in this case since we can argue that hearing the evidence should not carry greater weight than seeing the incident, and they may hold the judicial session even at a later date just as in the case of hearing evidence in general a judicial session may be held at a later date. Not so, however, when they saw the matter at night, in which case they only become witnesses and cannot act as Judges, for hearing the evidence is also not valid in the first instance if heard at night — M.E. but if they beheld it at night,24At which time judicial sessions are not held. , supra § 5, 2. Likewise, if they beheld the incident on the Sabbath or Festival, they may not act as Judges, although the prohibition against trying cases on these days is only a Rabbinic measure (BaḤ). This question, however, requires further elucidation — ShaK. TaZ opposes BaḤ, for on the principle that in a Rabbinic matter a witness may act as a Judge (v. Isserles anon and supra n. 17), it should be permissible. Keneseth Ezekiel agrees with BaḤ. Tummim is in agreement with TaZ. K.H. concludes that we should adopt a leniency in this matter. Hence, they may hold a judicial session on a following day even if they beheld the incident on the Sabbath or Festival — P.Tesh. they may not hold a judicial session on [the strength of] their own evidence.25 supra n. 20. For in this case since judicial sessions are not held at night, they merely become designated as witnesses and we cannot apply the principle, ‘let the hearing of evidence not carry greater weight than seeing the incident,’ since the time of seeing the incident was not the time of hearing the evidence, because we receive no evidence at night — M.E. However, on [the strength of] evidence given by others they may act as Judges.26The next day or even many days later. But if they were [originally] ordered to act as witnesses [in a certain matter, — then] even on [the strength of] evidence given by others, they may not act as Judges.27For in this case it carries even lesser weight than beholding the incident at night. Thus RaShBaM to B.B. ibid., where it is stated that ‘If three persons came to visit a sick man etc.’ (v. supra n. 17), whence it follows that they did not come at the express bidding of the testator to act as witnesses (note the words נכנסו לבקר), for if they were invited or ordered by the testator to come, they would be designated as witnesses, and consequently, even if they came during the day, they would not be able to act as Judges even if other witnesses give evidence. Some say, however, that even if they were [originally] ordered to act as witnesses [in a certain matter], they may act as Judges on [the strength of] evidence given by others.28This is similar to beholding the incident at night. Thus Tosaf. to B.B. ibid. RaN rules as follows: If they came with the express intent to act as witnesses, we adopt the view of Tosaf.; but if they were ordered to come and act as witnesse, we follow the opinion of RaShBaM. This entire [ruling] applies to a Biblical Law,29E.g., the sanctification of the new Moon. but in [the case of] a Rabbinic matter,30E.g., the confirmation of documents. [the law is that even] a witness [who testified] may act as a Judge.31Ket. 21b, Tosaf. s.v. הנח; N.Yos. ibid.; San. 34b — G. , supra n. 17. To sum up this ruling, the following principles should be borne in mind: a) Mere intention to act as witnesses of an incident does not invalidate the individuals from acting as Judges; b) Once they have testified they no longer may act as Judges; c) If they beheld the incident during the day, they may act as Judges; if at night, they may act as Judges if others testify; d) If they were summoned to act as witnesses, there is a difference of opinion between RaShBaM and Tosaf.; e) In a Rabbinic matter even a witness who testified may act as a Judge.",

    "text_en": "[With respect to] one who is summoned to be tried before a Judge who is inferior to him [in learning, — the law is that] the Judge [who summoned him to appear in Court] cannot compel him to go [and be tried] before him, but they call a meeting of the scholars who are [present] there and look into the matter among themselves.32Tur on the authority of R. Hai Gaon. Derived from Kid. 70a: ‘A certain individual from Nehardea entered a butcher’s shop in Pumbeditha and stated: Give me meat! They replied: Wait until the attendant of Rab Judah b. Ezekiel takes his and then we shall serve you. He exclaimed, Who is Rab Judah b. Shewiskel (a nickname for Ezekiel, derived from שזיסקי meaning roast, i.e., the eater of roast meat) to take precedence over me and to be served before me? They went and informed Rab Judah (about this), whereupon he pronounced the ban against him. They said to him (further), He (that man) is in the habit of calling people slaves, whereupon he (Rab Judah) announced that he (that man) was a slave (himself). Thereupon that man went and summoned him (Rab Judah) to a lawsuit before R. Naḥman. When they brought the writ of summons, Rab Judah went before R. Huna and asked him, Shall I go or not? (his high office gave him the right not to recognize R. Naḥman’s authority over himself). He (R. Huna) answered: Indeed you must not go because you are a distinguished personage, but on account of the honour of the Nasi’s house (R. Naḥman was the son-in-law of the Resh Galutha) arise and go.’ From this passage it follows that one is not obliged to appear before a Judge who is inferior to him. Furthermore, it does not depend upon the age of the Judge who sent the writ of summons, for even if the latter is much older than the scholar who is summoned, nevertheless, if in learning and knowledge he is inferior to him, he cannot compel him to appear before him (cf. B.B. 142b). The same principle applies to a single Judge or a Court of three who sent the writ of summons — P.Tesh. The mode of expression used here indicates that R. Hai Gaon holds that if the defendant agrees to be tried before a Judge who is inferior to him, he may appear before the latter for trial on the principle that ‘A Rabbi who renounces his honour, it is considered renounced’ (Kid. 32a-b). For if this were not so, how can the inferior scholar summon him to law in the first place. Hence, he may summon him only because there is a possibility that the latter may agree to come — P.Tesh. ‘They call a meeting of the scholars … themselves,’ means that the scholars of that locality examine the case together. Consequently, it is no longer disreputable for him to be tried in their presence — Tummim. BaḤ explains that the words, ‘and look into the matter’ means that they investigate the case in order to determine whether it is proper for him to appear for trial or not. In a case where it is not respectable for the scholar to appear in Court with a litigant who is an uncultured person, the Court may send scribes to the scholar’s home in order to record his arguments in writing and then they adjudicate the case on the basis of the recorded information — M.E. , infra § 124. Cf. also infra § 28, 5.",

Papa said, One should not adjudicate a lawsuit either for one whom he loves or for one whom he hates; for he will not see the guilt of one whom he loves, or notice the merit of one whom he hates.’ This text does not state the degree of friendship or enmity. Tosaf. a.l., s.v. הא writes that this is not similar to the degree of friendship or enmity that disqualifies witnesses from giving evidence according to R. Judah who defines a friend as one’s groomsman and an enemy as one who out of enmity has not spoken to an individual for three days (San. 27a. The majority of the Rabbis [San. ibid.] hold contra R. Judah that Israelites are not to be suspected of giving false evidence on account of friendship or enmity and consequently may testify), for in the case of Judges, even the Rabbis will admit that one is ineligible to act as a Judge for a friend or enemy as defined by R. Judah, for it is difficult for the Judges to be unprejudiced and impartial under such circumstances (derived from a Scriptural text ibid. 29a). In Ket. we deal with a ‘friend’ as reported in the case of Amemar who was adjudicating an action when a bird flew down upon his head and a man removed it therefrom. When Amemar asked him what he was doing there, he told him that he came with a lawsuit. Whereupon Amemar stated that he was disqualified to act as his Judge. This was an added stringency because legally Amemar was not ineligible. Caro, however, in the present ruling (following Maim.) by stating, ‘It is forbidden etc.,’ (אסור) apparently disagrees with Tosaf. and holds that the prohibition is not on account of a mere stringency. The only similarity between Caro and Tosaf. is that the meaning of the terms ‘friend’ and ‘enemy’ used in the case of Judges is different from the meaning of these terms employed in the context of evidence (v. RIDBaZ to Yad ibid.). If both litigants are equally his friends or his enemies, one should not act as their Judge — P.Tesh. A.H., however, permits him to act as Judge even in the first instance. If a witness is signed on a document, he may not act as a Judge in the confirmation of that document (R. Yeruḥam) — ShaK. Cf. infra § 46, 24. although he is not his groomsman34San. 27b, 29a. He is regarded as such the entire seven days of the marriage feast — M.E. Thus also Rashi ibid. According to the Rabbis on the authority of Raba (San. 29a) after the first day he is no longer regarded as his groomsman. Tummim states that nowadays since most of the people do not make the feast for seven days, all admit that after the first day he is no longer considered his groomsman. or his companion whom [he loves] as his own self,35San. ibid. or one whom he hates,33Yad Sanhedrin XXIII, 6. Derived from Ket. 105b: ‘R.

If a witness is signed on a document, he may not act as a Judge in the confirmation of that document (R. Yeruḥam) — ShaK. Cf. infra § 46, 24. although he is not his enemy nor does he seek his harm.36 Nnm. XXXV, 23. Cf. Ket. ibid. and supra n. 33. In the case of one who borrowed money from a scholar and subsequently denied having received the loan and took a false oath, and later appeared before this scholar with a lawsuit, the law is that the scholar should not act as his Judge, for he will not see any merit for him — Ḥawwoth Ya’ir. But it is necessary that both litigants should be equal in the eyes of the Judges and in their heart.37San. 7b-8a: ‘You shall not respect persons (לא תכירו) in judgment (Deut. I, 17). R. Judah says, this means, You shall not favour him (if he is your friend) ; and R. Eleazar says, (If he is your enemy) do not discriminate against him). Rab’s host came before him with a lawsuit and said, Were you not once my guest? Yes, he replied (and what is your request?) I have a lawsuit. Whereupon Rab said, I am ineligible to act as your Judge.’ And if the [Judge] did not personally know either of them at all nor [each] one's doings, there is no more righteous Judge than he.38Sifre Deut. XVI: ‘Hear the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between a man and his brother (Deut. I, 16) — The righteous in his righteousness claims and offers evidence,’ i.e., the Judge must not be guided by his moral convictions or by the reputation of the claimant, but by evidence only. Gloss: But if they had [already] tried [the case of a friend or enemy] their decision is binding.39Hag. Asheri San. beg. — G. According to this opinion one is forbidden to act as Judge even in the case of a real friend or enemy only in the first instance (לכתחילה), but ex post facto, (בדיעבד), the decision is binding — M.E. Accordingly, R. Papa’s dictum in Ket. ibid. applies even to a real friend or enemy as stated in San. ibid. and the prohibition refers only to the first instance. Some, however, say that in [the case of] one's real enemy, i.e., one to whom he has not spoken for three days out of enmity, or his real friend, i.e., one's groomsman and companion, — [the law is that] their decision is not binding.40Tur — G. According to this opinion the decision given in the case of a real friend or enemy is not binding even ex post facto — M.E. This follows from Mishna San. ibid. where in the case of testimony, a real friend or enemy is eligible to testify according to the Rabbis, but as far as Judges are concerned they are ineligible. , supra n. 33. If a litigant approves of the Judge who is a friend or a groomsman of his fellow-litigant, — the latter cannot object to be tried by this Judge — Tummim. Still others say that whoever is not his real friend or enemy, he is permitted to judge, and it is considered merely a measure of piety41e., the conduct of a very scrupulous person. to adopt a stringent view not to judge him.42San. 8a, Tosaf. s.v. פסילנא. Therefore, one is permitted to be a Judge when each [litigant] chooses one Judge [and the two Judges jointly choose the third],43 infra § 13 beg. — G. But one who Biblically is considered a relative or otherwise ineligible is unfit to be a Judge, even if each litigant chooses one Judge etc. (Mishna San. 23a-b). Hence, Isserles writes, ‘Therefore etc.,’ i.e., since the prohibition is merely a measure of piety, it follows that in the case of one who is unfit Biblically, he may not act as Judge. because each [litigant] chooses his friend;44Each one chooses a Judge who understands his case well, and if each Judge finds some merit in favour of his friend who chose him, he will present it to his fellow-Judge, and the third Judge will then harmonize the conflicting opinions. Hence, even if he is his friend and will see only merit for him, it applies to the other as well, and with the harmonization of the conflicting opinions by the third Judge a true verdict will be reached — M.E. and much more so that a teacher can be a Judge for his disciple.45MaHaRIK Rt. 16 — This refers to the preceding ruling, viz., that in the case of a litigant who is not his real friend or enemy, the prohibition is only on account of a measure of piety. Derived from Shab. 30b: ‘And Rabbah son of R. Huna stated: If a Rabbinical scholar and an illiterate person have a legal dispute with each other, the scholar should not come first and sit down (before the Judge prior to the arrival of his opponent even if he keeps his silence) for it appears as if he is presenting his case (which is forbidden before the opponent arrives). And we say this only when he has no fixed time (for study) with him; but if he has a fixed time (for study) with him, we have nothing against this (i.e., if the Judge is his teacher and this is the appointed time for his lesson, the scholar is permitted to arrive before his opponent), because he (his opponent) will say, he is busy with his lesson.’ We, therefore, see that no prohibition exists against a teacher acting as Judge for his disciple. The Judge may also adjudicate a case of the father of his disciple, although he receives tuition fees from him — M.E. Likewise, may one act as Judge in lawsuits involving his host, employees or daily workers — ShaK. And even a Court that is unfit to judge on account of friendship or enmity can appoint other eligible Judges [in order] that they adjudicate [the case in question].46Decisions of Isserlein s. 258 and MaHaRIK Rt. 21 — G. , San. 8a. MaHaRIK ibid. writes that even one who adopts a stringent view out of piety is fit to choose Judges. Isserlein ibid. states that every Court that is ineligible to adjudicate a case, has a right to appoint another Court — M.E. However, one who is unfit to judge on account of kinship may not appoint another Beth Din unless such is the prevailing custom in that particular community — Nethiboth. One who makes a statement concerning a Judge that he is his enemy or a friend of his opponent, is not believed, and he is required [to adduce] proof [in order to substantiate] his words.47Tur — G. Mishna San. 23a in accord with the Sages: ‘Each party may refuse to accept the Judge chosen by the other. So holds R. Meir. But the Sages say that this applies only if the objector can bring proof against them that they are kinsmen or otherwise ineligible.’ Tur has, ‘He must adduce proof that he has not spoken to him for three days out of enmity.’ [A Judge] who pronounces a ban against a fellow because [the latter] treated him disrespectfully, can [nevertheless] act as his Judge subsequently, since he is not [regarded thereby] his enemy.48 supra n. 32 regarding the case of the man who insulted Rab Judah b. Ezekiel and the latter placed him under a ban and subsequently declared him to be a slave, whence it follows that although he first placed him under a ban, yet, he did not hesitate later to designate him a slave, which shows that Rab Judah did not have the status of an enemy. In D.M., Isserles writes that this requires further elucidation. , M.E. who writes that Isserles is doubtful because while the ban is in force there still is enmity among them. Consequently, during the ban, the Judge who imposed it, should not try the same person for another offence. , infra § 33, 6.",

Should, however, the related litigant desire to declare the Judge ineligible, he has the right to do so — ShaK, A.H.51) A public announcement (הכרזה) is required to be made with respect to a person who Rabbinically is disqualified to act as a witness.

III: ‘Whence is it derived that the witnesses should not be related to each other? — This follows from your own logical deduction, (viz.,) that if one of them was proven to be a Zomem (v. Deut. XIX, 19), is he put to death (by the law of retaliation) before his fellow (-witness) is (also) proven to be a Zomem? — (Certainly not.) Consequently, since the law of retaliation operates only if both witnesses are proven to be Zomemim, it follows that if both witnesses are related to each other, each kinsman-witness would be put to death through the testimony of his fellow kinsman-witness (which is impossible on the basis of the text, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers — Deut. XXIV, 16, — which is explained anon to intimate that all relations, not only fathers and sons, are not to be put to death through the testimony of other relations. , Y. anon and cf. San. 27b-28a). (For) if you say thus (i.e., that witnesses may be related to each other, would not the result be that one kinsman-witness) is put to death on his (i.e., the other kinsman-witness) testimony? Whence is it derived that the witnesses should not be related to the Judges? — This follows from your own logical deduction, (viz.,) that if they (the witnesses who are related to the Judges) are proven to be Zomemim, would not (the result be that) they (the witnesses) are put to death through their (the Judges’) verdict (i.e., after the Judges receive the refutation of the testimony that was given by the witnesses who were related to the Judges) ? Whence is it derived that the Judges should not be related to each other? — Scripture states : Put to death on the testimony of witnesses (v. Deut. XIX, 15) ; Put to death according to the decision of Judges (v. Deut. XVII, 11) — just as witnesses must not be related to each other, so too, must the Judges not be related to each other.’ Cf. also infra § 46, 21.

Derived from Sheb. 30b: ‘Whence do we derive that a Judge who knows his colleague to be a robber or a witness who knows his colleague to be a robber should not join with him (to judge or testify) ? — Because it is said, From a false matter keep far (Ex.

BaḤ therefore, explains that supra we deal with a Judge who is distinguished in wisdom and learning, in which case he should first make certain about the eligiblity of his colleague; whereas in the present ruling we treat of an ordinary Judge who is permitted to join with a colleague to sit in judgment unless it is known to him that the latter is a robber or a wicked person. Tummim removes the contradiction by explaining that supra we deal with the commencement of a trial, in which case one must make certain that his colleague is fit to judge; whereas here we deal with a case where the trial had already commenced and he thought that his colleague was an eligible person, but during the proceedings it became clear to him that his colleague was ineligible to judge, in which case the law is that if he knows him to be a robber etc., he must discontinue the proceedings (note the expression לישב employed supra and להצטרף used here). Shebuth Ya‘akob explains that supra we deal with a Judge who does not know his other two colleagues. Hence, he must not sit with them before he determines their eligibility. Otherwise, he is regarded as associating himself with a council of conspirators, since the majority of the members of the Court are unfit to judge. However, if two of the Judges know each other, but they do not know the third Judge, there would actually be no prohibition if they associated themselves with the latter, yet, the pure-minded of Jerusalem would refrain from sitting in judgment with such a Judge until they would be certain about his eligibility (v. supra § 3, n. 33). The present ruling, however, has reference to a case where one of the three Judges knows one of his colleagues to be a robber etc., in which case he must not join with him, even if the third Judge is fit, for although this Court is not regarded as a council of conspirators since the majority of its members are fit, yet, it is forbidden on account of the Biblical injunction, From a false matter keep far. If the litigants accepted the ineligible Judge, there is no prohibition against joining with the latter since there are two eligible Judges, and consequently, it is not considered a council of conspirators and the verse, From a false etc., is not applicable — A.H.",

Cf. Gen. XVIII, 19 and Rashi a.l. [and] possessed of a good name.57 infra § 8, 1. — G. This is the meaning of ‘able men’ (אנשי חיל), i.e., individuals who are endowed with the will-power to act justly and righteously and thereby acquire a fine reputation. Tur citing Yad, Sanhedrin II, 7. The following sources enumerate the qualities that a Judge must possess: Tosef (Ẓ). San. VII, 1; ibid. Hag. II, 9; Y. San. I, 4(19c); San. 88b. In the three latter sources the quality of ‘humility’ (ענו) is mentioned after ‘wisdom’ (חכם). The quality of ‘humility,’ however, is not found in the following additional sources: Deut. R. I, 10 to v. 13 ibid.: ‘R. Berekiah on the authority of R. Ḥaninah stated: Judges must possess the following seven qualities: (They must be) wise men (חכמים), understanding (נבונים), full of knowledge (ידועים). Hence we have three. And four more as it is written elsewhere (Ex. XVIII, 21), Thou shalt provide out of all the people able men (אנשי חיל), such as fear G-d (יראי אלקים ), men of truth (אנשי אמת), hating unjust gain (שונאי בצע). Hence, we have seven. Why were not the seven stated together? (To intimate) that if (Judges) were not found (endowed) with seven (qualities), one may bring (Judges) possessing (only) four (qualities) ; and if (Judges) were not found (endowed) with four (qualities), one may bring those possessing three (qualities); and if these were not found, one may bring (Judges) possessing one (quality), for it is written, A woman of valour who can find (Prov. XXXI, 10).’ In the last verse quoted it seems that the Midrash takes a woman of valour (אשת חיל) as equivalent to able men mentioned in Ex. ibid., i.e., even if the Judges possessed only one quality, it suffices. Cf. Prov. ibid. v. 23: Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. This refers to the gates of justice where local matter were adjudicated. Hence, the connection between the text in Prov. and that of Ex. , MaHaRZaW to Deut. R. ibid. Cf. also Sifre to Deut. ibid. on the seven qualities that a Judge should possess. Maim. (followed by Tur and Caro) considers ‘wise men’ and ‘understanding’ (חכמים ונבונים) as one quality. Hence, he adds the quality of ‘humility’ (ענוה), although it is not mentioned in Deut. R. However, it seems that he followed San. B. and Y. and Tosef Hag. ibid., where ענן is mentioned. , Leḥem Mishneh to Yad ibid. ‘Humility’ was a quality that Moses possessed, Now the man Moses was very humble (ענו) — Num. XIII, 3 — and since in Ex. ibid. v. 22 it is stated, so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee: ‘with thee’ implies like unto thee (Kid. 76b; San. 36b; Hor. 4b), it follows that Judges who are appointed must also be endowed with the quality of humility or meekness as in the case of Moses. Cf. Maim. Yad ibid. who elaborates on the qualities to be possessed by Judges and gives a different order from that mentioned in the above texts.",

    "text_en": "Every case concerning which there results indirect benefit to the Judge, he [the Judge] cannot adjudicate. Therefore, [if] a Torah scroll belonging to the townspeople has been stolen, he [the alleged culprit] is not tried by the Judges of that town,58B.B. 43a: ‘Has it not been taught: If a Torah scroll belonging to the townspeople was stolen, (the alleged culprit who claims that he bought it — Thus RaShBaM), must not be tried by the Judges of that town, nor can evidence be given (against him) by the inhabitants of that town (because they are all interested parties). Now if we adopt the opinion that a partner can renounce his interest (v. Gemara supra), why cannot two of the inhabitants of the town renounce their interest in the scroll and try (the alleged culprit) ? — A Torah scroll is different because it is utilized for public reading (hence, none of the inhabitants of that town can entirely renounce his interest in it, unless he leaves the town. Consequently, all are considered interested parties). Come and hear: If one says, Give a Maneh to the poor of my town (and it was stolen, the alleged culprit) … must not be tried by the poor Judges of that town, nor may the poor of that town give evidence … Cannot two of them renounce their interest and adjudicate the case? — Here too, we (treat of) a Torah scroll and the reason why the donor referred to the recipients as poor is because all are poor with respect to a Torah scroll.’ , Yad, ‘Eduth XV, 2. unless they have another Torah scroll.59In the Synagogue where the Judge or Judges worship. For then the Judges are no longer interested parties. But if in this Synagogue there is no other Torah scroll available, though there is another Synagogue in town where they have a Torah scroll, yet, in order for the Judges to be permitted to try the case, they must renounce their interest in this Synagogue. This is derived from RaShBaM to B.B. ibid., s.v. דהכל אצל: ‘All are in need of the Torah scroll, and it is customary to refer to the townspeople who have no Torah scroll as poor (v. text supra n. 58 and), for there is no greater poverty than this.’ It follows, therefore, that only when this is the only Torah scroll they possess that they are designated poor, but if they have in addition another scroll, then after renouncing their interest, they may adjudicate the case and are permitted to read even in the disputed Torah scroll. Thus also Tur; Asheri in Resp. and R. Yeruḥam. Similarly, when the controversy is regarding the Synagogue where the Judge worships, he must renounce his interest in that Synagogue and worship in the other Synagogue; but when he attends his own Synagogue, although he can go to the other Synagogue, despite the fact that he renounces his interest in his Synagogue, he is still regarded as an interested party — M.E. contra ‘Ir Shushan. Moreover, the circumstances must be such that all the townspeople could be accomodated at the other Synagogue. Otherwise, the Judge would still be regarded as an interested party because the law is that townspeople who are in need of a Synagogue may compel each other to build one (v. infra § 163, 1) and consequently, the Judge will also have to contribute. Hence, if the other Synagogue is not large enough to accomodate all the worshippers of the disputed Synagogue, they are all considered interested parties, for they all desire to regain possession of their Synagogue. However, if the Judge’s seat in the disputed Synagogue is his own property, he is not regarded as an interested party, provided the ‘seven representatives of the town’ (שבעה טובי העיר) have no right to sell the Synagogue or the Torah scrolls for the needs of the community (v. Y.D. § 282). Otherwise, the Judge is always considered an interested party — Tummim, A.H. And [likewise,] one who says, 'Distribute a Maneh to the poor of my town,' [and it was stolen, — the alleged culprti] is not tried by the Judges of that town.60B.B. ibid. , text supra n. 58. Yad, ‘Eduth XV, 3. For they are pleased if the poor have a surplus because they will not be called upon to pay. Therefore, even if the Judge is willing to continue to make his regular contributions to the poor, and even if the judgment will be rendered in favour of the poor, yet, he is still regarded as an interested party. , supra § 4 that if one takes possession of aught that belongs to them [the towns-people] they may take the law into their own hands. , infra § 37, par. 19 and par. 20 concerning these laws. Consequently, taxation disputes are not tried by the Judges of that town, because they [the Judges] or their relatives have an interest therein,61Tur on the authority of Asheri. but if it is a [dispute concerning a] special tax, e.g., [an assessment] that obtains only at a fixed time,— [the law is that] some [inhabitants] of the community62By paying their assessment in advance no matter what the outcome of the case will be. can renounce their share [in this special tax] so that they derive no benefit therefrom. And [consequently,] they may adjudicate [the case]. Asheri [in] Resp. 26, s. 18 writes that [renunciation] has no legal effect and [yet in] rule 99 he states that [renunciation does have a legal effect. Hence, we must make a distinction between a special tax [where renunciation is legally binding62By paying their assessment in advance no matter what the outcome of the case will be. and a permanent tax where renunciation has no legal effect].63Latter interpretation in B.B. ibid.: ‘If you wish I can say that the poor literally are referred to and we deal with poor whose support rests upon the Judges (who are wealthy). How is this to be understood? If there is a fixed amount (for them to give), let two of them give their donation and then adjudicate the case (since they are thus no longer interested in the donation). We understand this to mean that there is no fixed amount (for them to donate, but the contribution is made only when the occasion arises. Hence, as long as there is still a possibility of collecting the money from the alleged culprit, they are still interested parties).’ It follows therefore, that just as in the case of a charitable contribution which is not fixed, renounciation is ineffective, so, too, in the case of a permanent tax it is impossible to establish with certainty that no benefit will be derived at some time or other. For it is impossible to know how long the person who is tried will live in order for the Judges to know how much they should pay as their share so as not to be regarded as interested parties — B.Yos. It is only in the case of a special tax where the amount to be renounced may be established that renunciation is effective. However, if they made an ordinance,64B.B. 8b. , text supra § 2, n. 18; B.K. 116b: ‘Ass-drivers are permitted to stipulate that one who loses his ass should be provided with another ass,’ i.e., even if it against the law. , Tosaf. s.v. ורשאין. However, if the Judges of a certain locality feel that other Judges from another town should be invited to try a case in their town, they should do so — A.H. or there is a prevailing custom in town65B.K. ibid.: ‘Our Rabbis taught: If a caravan was travelling through the wilderness and a troop of invading robbers threatened to pillage it, the contribution to be paid by each (in order to buy off the robbers) is calculated according to one’s possessions (in the caravan), but not in accordance with the number of people there (because we assume that the invading robbers came originally for the possessions and not necessarily for the people). But if they hired a guide to go before them, the calculation has to be made also (also is wanting in Y. B.M. VI, 4(11a)) in accordance with the number of people in the caravan (because a guide is essential also to protect one’s life) and they must not deviate from the general practice of the ass-drivers (i.e., if they stipulate to make the calculation according to possessions or persons, they may do so).’ The same applies to the general custom of mariners stated further ibid. Hence, we see that we follow the adopted practice although it is against the law. , also Mishna B.M. VII, 1(83a) and Gemara a.l. that the Judges of the town should also try cases pertaining to taxation disputes, their decision is binding.66 infra § 37, 22 concerning this — G.",

    "text_en": "Whoever appoints an unworthy Judge,1San. 7b; A.Z. 52a: ‘Resh Lakish stated: Whoever appoints an unworthy Judge over the community is as though he planted an Ashera in Israel, for it is written, Judges and officers shalt thou appoint thee, and near it is said, Thou shalt not plant thee an Ashera of any kind of tree (Deut. XVI, 18-19).’ Tree refers to a Judge. , Ta‘an. 7a to Deut. XX, 19. or2Lit. ‘and,’ which is to be understood here not as the Waw explicativum (as the English ‘to wit’), but rather as the Waw copulativum that introduces an alternate item, i.e., having the meaning of ‘or.’ , Kimḥi’s Heb. Gram., ed. Chomsky p. 352. Hence, the meaning here is a) One must not appoint an unworthy Judge, i.e., one who is unworthy in his deeds or actions, though he may be a scholar, or b) One who is not a scholar, though he is considered worthy in deeds (-a totally pleasant individual, i.e., outwardly his actions are becoming). The ruling supra § 3 that even if one of the Judges is versed in law and is endowed with reasoning power, it suffices, has reference only to ex post facto decisions. However, in the first instance, the Judges who are appointed permanently must be versed in the law. , supra § 3, n. 42. one who has no knowledge in the wisdom of the Torah and is not fit to be a Judge,3San. 7b: ‘The members of the Nasi’s household once appointed a Judge who was incompetent. The Rabbis said to R. Judah b. Naḥmani, the interpreter of Resh Lakish: Stand at his side as interpreter. When he stood at his side and bent down (to hear what he was saying), the (interpreter) said nothing. Whereupon R. Judah commenced his exposition and said, Woe unto him who saith unto wood: Awake! — to the dumb stone: Arise! Can this teach? Behold it is overlaid with gold and silver and there is no breath at all in the midst of it (Hab. II, 19); but the Holy One, blessed be He, (he continued) will punish those who set them up, as it is written, But the Lord in His holy Temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him (ibid.).’ — even if he is a totally pleasant [individual]4e., he is full of charm. , Song of Songs V, 16. and possesses other good [qualities], — [yet,] the one who appointed him transgresses a negative precept.5Sifre XVII to Deut. I, 17, Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, i.e., one must not respect his friend by appointing him as a Judge because the latter is wealthy, or is a relative of his or for any other similar reason. Cf. Yad, Sanhedrin III, 8. Gloss: It is forbidden to appoint an unlearned person [as] a Judge on reliance that [in every legal matter] he will always consult a scholar.6B.Yos. — G. Derived from Shab. 139a: ‘What is the meaning of the verse, The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the sceptre of the rulers? (Is. XIV, 5). Mar Zutra said. This refers to scholars who teach the laws of the public to ignorant Judges,’ i.e., the ignorant Judges are appointed in reliance that they will consult the scholars in doubtful matters, but they act of their own accord and thus pervert justice (Rashi). Hence, we see that an ignorant Judge should not be appointed on the reliance that he will always consult the scholar. [In] towns where there are no scholars [available] who are fit to be Judges, or where all of them are unlearned people and they require Judges to adjudicate [cases] among them so that they go not before heathen Courts, — [the law is that] they may appoint [as Judges] the best and the wisest of them with the consent of the townspeople, although they are not fit [to be] Judges.7Mishna San. 23a according to which R. Meir holds that each litigant may refuse to accept the Judge chosen by the other and the Gemara (ibid.) explains that R. Meir maintains thus only in the case of Syrian Courts whose Judges were unversed in Jewish law; but the Sages hold that if they are fit, they are regarded as Mumḥin appointed by the Beth Din and cannot be disqualified, i.e., since they were accepted by all the townspeople as Judges they may not be disqualified, provided there are no Mumḥin available there. , supra § 3, n. 4. However, once the townspeople accepted them [as Judges] no other person can disqualify them.8, previous note. Likewise, [the members of] an entire community can accept a Court of Law [that consists of Judges] who are not fit [to judge] Biblically.9B.Yos. on the authority of RaShBA, Resp. — G. , infra § 33, 18 Gloss. And every Judge who gets appointed on account of silver or gold, — [the law is that] it is forbidden to rise before him;10Caro’s text has לפניו which should be corrected to מפניו. Thus Y. , following note. and what is more, it is a religious duty to treat him with disrespect and to despise him.11 supra § 3 end — G. Yad, Sanhedrin III, 9; Tur. Derived from Y. Bik. III, 3(65d); Midr. Sam. VII: ‘R. Mani spoke with disrespect of those that get appointed to office for money. R. Imi would apply to them the Scriptural verse, gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you (Ex. XX, 20). Said R. Joshiah: His official cloak is as befitting to him as the packsaddle of an ass. Said R. Sheyan: For one who is appointed to office on account of money, one should not rise, nor is he called Rabbi etc.’ , San. 7b: ‘It is written: Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver or gods of gold (Ex. ibid.). Does it mean that only gods of silver and gold are not to be made, but those of wood are permissible? — The verse, said R. Ashi, has reference to Judges appointed through the power of silver or gold.’ Cf. San. 63b: ‘All scoffing is forbidden except the ridiculing of idols (by perverting their names).’ Hence, just as idolators may be treated irreverently, so also Judges who are appointed through the power of money. This refers to a Judge unversed in Jewish Law, but if he is learned in the Torah, even if there are others greater than he in that city, there would be no prohibition against rising in his presence, provided he did not buy his judgeship for money, but was appointed to office because he was wealthy. For if he paid money to be appointed, even if he is the most learned in the city, the prohibition stands. Thus BaḤ. However, according to Tosaf. Yeshanim to Yoma 18a, s.v. מרתא in the case of R. Joshua b. Gamala who was appointed to the High Priesthood for money, only if there are others superior to him in learning does the prohibition apply, but not otherwise. Thus Ḥatam Sofer contra BaḤ.",

Eleazar, viz., One does not attain greatness until all his sins are forgiven (i.e., the greatness of holding office improves one’s moral personality), he was ready to become reconciled (to the idea).’ Y. Bik. III, 3(65c-d) bot.: ‘R. Ze‘ira, when they wanted to ordain him, did not want to accept (this office) upon himself. But when he heard that which was taught in a Baraitha, viz., that regarding a scholar, groom and a Nasi, greatness forgives (all sins), he accepted the appointment.’ until they knew that there was no other [authority] available there as competent as they26Heb. כמותם. Thus Yad ibid. Caro, however, has כמוהו ‘as he.’ Derived from Ber. 63a: ‘Where there is no man, then you should be a man (to spread the teachings of the Torah). Abaye said : From this you may infer that there is a man, then you should not be a man. This is self-evident? — This was required to be stated where both are equal (i.e., where there is another person who equals you in learning do not strive to attain office).’ , infra n. 28 end. and if they were to desist from [giving decisions] in the law, the natural order [of justice] would become upset.27A.Z. 19b: ‘R. Abba said on the authority of R. Huna, in the name of Rab, What is the meaning of the verse, For she hath cast down many wounded? (Prov. VII, 26) — This refers to a disciple who has not attained the age of ordination (the original הפילה is connected here with נפל non-viable birth) and yet, renders decisions; yea, a mighty host are her slain (ibid.), refers to a disciple who has attained the age of ordination, but avoids giving decisions,’ (the original עצומים is taken here as ‘those who refrain from rendering decisions,’ as עוצם עינין) -‘he shuts his eyes’ found in Is. XXXIII, 15). And what is the permissible age? — Forty years. But did not Rabbah render decisions? (although he died at the age of forty. , R.H. 18b. Cf. however, Halevy, Doroth II, 438 seq.; Funk, Die Juden in Babylonien II, n. 1) — There we deal with a case of equals (i.e., there was none greater than he available).’ Hence, if he surpasses all the others in learning he must accept the appointment. Otherwise, the natural order of justice is upset. Cf. supra § 7, n. 14. Yet, they would not sit in judgment until the people and the elders are urged to put pressure upon them and entreat them [to accept].28Hor. 10a-b: ‘. . Rather be astonished at two disciples you (R. Gamaliel) have on land, R. Eleazar Ḥisma and R. Joḥanan b. Gudgada who can calculate how many drops there are in the sea and have neither bread to eat nor clothes to wear. He (R. Gamaliel) decided to appoint them as overseers (in order for them to make a living) … he sent for them but they did not come. He then sent sent for them again and when they arrived he said to them, Do you think that I give you rulership? It is rather servitude that I give you, as it is said And they spoke to him saying : If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day (I Kings XII, 7, spoken by the old advisers to Rehoboam who was King of Judah and Israel).’ Cf. I Sam. X, 22. It follows that there must have been no others available for the office and yet, at first they refused to come. As to the passage in A.Z. ibid. (v. previous note) regarding a disciple who has attained the age of ordination, but avoids giving decisions to whom is applied the verse, yea, a mighty host are her slain, it refers to one who even after having been strongly urged to accept the office, still refuses, Or, it is possible that in A.Z. ibid., we deal with a case of a scholar who is unsurpassed in learning by anyone in his generation (v. Tur and Caro infra § 10, 3 and note the expression ‘and the generation has need of him’), but the present ruling treats of one who is superior in learning to all the scholars of that particular locality. However, elsewhere there are others who are available (note the expression used here ‘there was no other authority available there’) — M.E. , Sot. 22b, Tosaf. s.v. בשוין.",

Derived from Ned. 81a: ‘Why is it not a common occurrence for scholars to give birth to sons who are scholars? — R. Shisha, the son of R. Idi stated: In order that they may not be presumptuous towards the community (for were they, their fathers and grandparents all scholars they might act arrogantly towards the people).’ Every leader of a community who casts undue fear upon the community not for the sake of Heaven, will never have30Lit. ‘see.’ a scholarly son.31R.H. 17a: ‘Rab Judah stated on the authority of Rab: Any leader of a community who casts undue fear upon the community not for the sake of Heaven (but on account of selfish motives), will never have a scholarly son, for it is said, Therefore, if men fear him, he shall not see (among his sons) any wise of heart (Job. XXXVII, 2 E. has, Men do therefore fear Him; He regardeth not any that are wise of heart).’ Cf. supra n. 29. Likewise, is it forbidden to treat them [the people] with irreverence, although they are ignorant people.32Ned. ibid.: ‘R. Ashi said: Because they call people asses (i.e., because of their scholarship they take the liberty of treating the masses irreverently).’ They should not force their way33Lit. ‘trample over.’ over the heads of the holy people.34San. 7b: ‘Where is it intimated that a Judge must not stride over the heads of the holy people? (i.e., he must never force his way through the students who would sit on the floor, in order to reach his chair) — It is written, Neither shalt thou go up by steps (i.e., force your way) upon My altar (Ex. XX, 26), and further it is stated, And these are the judgments (Ibid. XXI, 1).’ Hence the Judge or teacher or expositor of the law should arrive before the audience. And even nowadays when everyone sits on chairs or benches, the same procedure should be observed by the Judge or teacher — M.E., ShaK. He [the Judge] must bear patiently with the trouble[s] of the community and their burden[s].35San. 8a: ‘And I charged your judges at that time (Deut. I, 16); and further, I charged you at that time (Ibid. I, 18). R. Eleazar, citing R. Simlai said: These verses are an admonition to the community to regard their Judges with awe, and to the Judges to bear with the community. To what extent? — R. Ḥanan, (some say R. Shabatai) says: As the nursing father carrieth the sucking child (Num. XI, 12).’ Cf. Yad ibid. XXV, 2-3. , also Ex. R. VII, 3; Sifre to Num. XI, 11-12. A religious duty rests upon the community to treat the Judge with respect and to hold him in reverence.36Lit. ‘his awe should be upon them.’ He [the Judge] too, should not make himself contemptible [through his conduct], nor should he act irreverently in their presence.37 supra n. 35. For once a man is appointed leader of the community,38This refers to a scholar who is appointed as Judge — P.Tesh. he is forbidden to do [manual labour] in the presence of three so that he should not make himself contemptible in their presence.39Kid. 70a: ‘Once a man is appointed leader of a community, he should not do (manual) work (in order to protect his dignity).’ Cf. Yad ibid. XXV,  And much more so40Lit. ‘a fortiori.’ that it is forbidden for him to eat and drink and to become intoxicated41Tur — G. So too, Yad ibid. in public.42Pes. 49a: ‘Our Rabbis taught: Every scholar who feasts sumptuously in every place, ultimately destroys his home, deserts his wife, is forced to leave his children unprovided for, forgets his learning, and becomes involved in many disputes, his words are not obeyed, and he profanes the Name of Heaven and the name of his teacher and the name of his father and he is the cause of an evil name for himself, his children and his childrens’ children ad infinitum (His great desire to feast in every place induces him to act likewise in his own home and in order to do so he sells his belongings etc. Financial disaster leads him into exile, thus deserting his wife and children and forgetting his learning. Or, unable to pay his bills he becomes involved in quarrels with his creditors. Furthermore, the feasting itself causes him to become entangled in disputes — Rashi Maharsha).’ This applies to an ordinary scholar, much more so if one is appointed leader of a community to adjudicate suits and to render decisions that he must be on guard against the mentioned pitfalls. Kid. 40b: ‘One who eats in the market-place is like a dog, and some say that he is ineligible to testify (since he has no self-respect).’ , Tosaf. s.v. יש אומרים a.l. who cite Y. (found in Ma‘as III, 5(50d)) according to which this prohibition has reference only to a scholar contra Kid., ibid where it is applied to any person. , explanations offered by Tosaf. Cf. also Koh. R. II to Eccl. II, 17 where it is stated that R. Hoshaiah found his Judges drinking wine excessively in the market-place and applied to himself the verse, So I hated life; (because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me). Cf. Yad, De‘oth V, 2; infra § 34, 18. Even at a festivity of a religious nature he should not become intoxicated, and at a gathering of ignorant people or at a social party, he should not eat at all — M.E. Every Judge who has no one to attend upon him is forbidden to accept [an appointment] to be a Judge.43Hag. Maim. to Yad, Sanhedrin XXV — G. Derived from Y. San. II, 6(20c-d): ‘He (R. Joḥanan) saw R. Ḥanina b. Sisi split wood. Said he to him: It is not dignified for you (to do this). The latter answered him, What am I to do, I have no one to attend upon me. Whereupon he (R.

Thus in Yeb.; דמצער ‘who harasses’ in Kid. Hence, Caro employs both terms) towards the messenger of the Rabbis (either the representative of the Beth Din sent to summon him to Court — thus Rashi; or the messenger of any Rabbi — So Tosaf.). , also Kid. 70b and cf. Yad, Sanhedrin XXV,  and he who harasses him [the messenger], — [the law is that] the Court has the authority to inflict upon him the penalty of chastisement.45Heb. מכת מרדות Lit. ‘stripes for rebellion,’ i.e., punishment for disobedience left to the discretion of the Court in contradistinction to the Biblically ordained punishment of 40(39) lashes. This ruling is applicable only when there are witnesses who testify that he harassed him; but on the statement of the messenger alone, the recalcitrant defendant may only be placed under the ban, although the decree of the ban is regarded as more severe than lashes, yet, so far as reliance on testimony is concerned, the statement of the Court messenger is not valid in order to inflict the penalty of chastisement upon the defendant. This may be derived from the fact that we do not accept the testimony of the Court messenger alone in order to make the defendant pay for the expense of the Court warrant, much more so in the case of bodily punishment. Cf. B.K. 112b: ‘The messenger of the Rabbis is as reliable (when informing the Court that the defendant refuses to appear) as two witnesses; this is the case only with reference to decreeing the ban (Shameta), but for writing a warrant (Pethiḥa, at the defendant’s expense), since he (the messenger) puts him (the recalcitrant defendant) to expense, — for the latter has to pay the scribe (for drafting the writ of excommunication), it is not so (i.e., the Court messenger’s statement is not as credible as the testimony of two witnesses)’ — M.E. , infra § 11, 1.

(We will not come up).’ , Num. XVI, 12-14. Yad ibid. par. 6. Thus it is evident that the messenger’s report is not considered slander. Otherwise, G-d would have instructed Moses not to include it in the Bible. Likewise, can he [the messenger] take the law into his own hands [in order to execute the Court order] should he [the defendant] act rebelliously towards him, [i.e., he is permitted] to strike him [the defendant],47B.K. 28a: ‘And putteth forth her hand (Deut.

    "text_en": "The Judge must be exceedingly1Heb. מאד מאד is employed to emphasize the extreme care that the Judge must take not to be tempted to accept bribes since man is endowed with a natural desire to accept gifts. The same expression is used by Tur in Y.D. § 160 beg. regarding the prohibition to take usury; ibid. § 336 beg. ref. to the physician who heals; Tur E.H. § 21 ref. to incest. Cf. Ab. IV, 4: ‘Be exceedingly humble’ (מאד מאי הוי שפל רוח), because by nature man is haughty — M.E. For any matter that involves the possibility of a material loss (in our case the gift or bribe that is given to the Judge which is forbidden) requires urging on since it is contrary to human nature not to accept. Cf. Sifra to Lev. VI, 2. , supra § 7, n. 33. careful not to take a bribe even to acquit the innocent,2Ket. 105a: ‘Was it not taught: What was intimated by the text, And thou shalt take no gift? (Ex. XXIII, 8). If to teach that one must not acquit the guilty or that one must not condemn the innocent, (we may object because) it has already been stated in the Bible, Thou shalt not wrest judgment (Deut. XVI, 19). Hence, even if (the Judge wishes) to acquit the innocent or condemn the guilty, the Torah states, And thou shalt take no gift.’ Ibid. 105b: ‘Why is it called Shoḥad (שוחד taken as contraction of שהוא חד, it is one) ? — Because it is one.’ (the recipient and the donor become one person). Cf. also Sifre to Deut. XVI, 19. The prohibition against accepting bribes refers not only to Judges but to all persons who are entrusted with communal matters although no adjudication of law is involved — P.Tesh. Likewise is it forbidden to accept equal bribes from both litigants although the foregoing reason no longer applies — M.E. The Judge must not accept any gifts from the acquitted party even after the conclusion of the trial — Asheri to San. 27a in the case of Bar Ḥama. and if he accepted it, he must return it when the donor claims it.3Yad, Sanhedrin XXIII,  Derived from Tem. 4b: ‘Abaye stated: Every act which the Divine Law prohibits, if it has been executed, the act has its legal effect; for if you were to entertain the opinion that the act does not have its legal effect why is one punished by lashes (on account thereof)? But Raba says that the act does not have its legal effect at all and the reason why one is punished by lashes is because he has transgressed a commandment of the Divine Law.’ After a number of texts are adduced according to which in some cases the transgression of a negative command has its legal effect while in others it does not,— concerning which Abaye and Raba agree, — the Talmud continues ibid. 6a-b: ‘R. Aḥa, the son of Raba said to R. Ashi . . In what respect do Abaye and Raba differ? — They differ with respect to direct usury (ריבית קצוצה i.e., lending four Denari in return for five) in accord with R. Eleazar. For R. Eleazar stated: Direct usury can be collected through the Judges, whereas indirect usury (אבק ריבית, lit. ‘dust of usury,’ e.g., if one sells his field and says to the buyer that if he pays him forthwith the price is one thousand Zuz, but if at a later date the price will be more. Consequently, if the buyer pays at the later date, the additional amount is regarded as indirect usury) cannot be collected through the Judges. R. Joḥanan states: Even direct usury is not collected through the Judges (Hence, Raba will conour with R. Eleazar and Abaye with R. Yoḥanan). But do they (Abaye and Raba) differ merely in logical reasoning? Do they not differ in the interpretation of Biblical texts? For R. Isaac said: He hath given forth upon usury and had taken increase: shall he than live? He shall not live (Ez. XVIII, 13), which teaches that the taking of usury is a matter that concerns life but is not liable to restoration (consequently, even Raba who holds that a prohibited act does not have its legal effect, here he will admit that the act is valid on account of the text). R. Aḥa b. Adda says: From here: Scripture states, But fear thy G-d (Lev. XXV, 36), teaching that the taking of usury is a matter of fearing G-d, but is not liable to restoration. Raba stated: From here: He hath done all these abominations: he shall surely die: his blood shall be upon him (Ez. XVIII, 13). Now, lo, if he begat a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood (ibid. XVIII, 10). Those who lend on interest are comparable to those who shed blood. Just as those who shed blood cannot make restoration (of the lost lives), so those who lend on interest are not liable to restoration (of interest). R. Naḥman b. Isaac stated: What is the reason of R. Eleazar? (who maintains that direct usury is collectible through the Judges), for the Biblical text says: That thy brother may live with thee (Lev. XXV, 36) thus teaching that he must restore the interest so that he (the borrower) may live with you.’ Consequently, since the law rests with Raba (excluding certain cases), bribes are equated to usury and are collectible through the Judges, which means that the donor claims it. M.E. writes that if the donor does not claim the return of the gift, the Judge is not obliged to return it, because the donor gave it willingly for the purpose of being acquitted contrary to usury concerning which it is written That thy brother may live with thee. TaZ disagrees with M.E. on the basis of Rashi to B.M. 61b, s.v. ע״כ ריבית קצוצה according to whom the Court may also compel him to return the usury only if he claimed it. Thus also TaZ to Y.D. § 161, 5, n. 3. Even if the donor claimed the bribe after a considerable time had elapsed, yet, as long as he did not renounce his rights to it, he may still make a claim. However, it is proper that the recipient of the bribe should return it of his own accord if he wishes to do his duty towards G-d and repent — P.Tesh. Just as the one who receives it transgresses a negative command, so does the donor transgress [the negative command], 'Thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind.'4Lev. XIX, 14. Thus Yad ibid., derived from the law of usury, for just as we deduce the law of returning bribes from the law of usury so too do we deduce from the law of usury that the one who gives bribes transgresses the negative injunction, And thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind, i.e., the one who offers a bribe tempts the Judge and thereby places a stumbling block before him. , Mishna B.M. 75b: ‘These transgress a negative injunction : the lender, the borrower, the surety and the witnesses. And the Sages add: the scribe too. They transgress the injunction, Thou shalt not give (him thy money upon usury) [Lev. XXV, 37] and Take thou (no usury) of him (Lev. XXV, 36) and Thou shalt not be to him as a usurer (Ex. XXII, 24) and Neither shall ye lay upon him usury (Ex. XXII, 25) and Thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy G-d: I am the Lord (Lev. XIX, 14).’ Gemara ibid.: ‘Abaye said: The lender transgresses all (the injunctions); the borrower: Thou shalt not cause thy brother to take usury (Deut. XXIII, 20. Heb. תשיך is in the Hiph‘il which is causitive. Hence, it refers to the debtor), but unto thy brother thou shalt offer no usury (ibid. v. 21), and thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind. The surety and the witnesses: only, neither shall ye lay upon him usury.’ One is forbidden to give a bribe to a Gentile Judge on the basis of and thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind, for civil laws are also binding upon all Noaḥides. But if it is evident that the Gentile Judge desires to pervert justice in favour of one of the litigants, it is permissible (Ḥatam Sofer) — P.Tesh. And not only a bribe of money [is forbidden] but even a bribe of words [or acts].5Ket. 105b: ‘Our Rabbis taught: And thou shalt take no bribe. (Ex. XXIII, 8); it was not necessary to speak of a monetary bribe, but (the following was intimated) : Even a bribe of words (or acts) is also prohibited, for it is not written, And thou shalt take no GAIN (Heb. בצע which would refer to a monetary bribe only).’ Cf. the cases of Samuel and Amemar a.o. mentioned ibid., who refused to act as Judges for people who acted in a manner that would be tantamount to a bribe of words or acts. Cf. Y.D. § 161, where the same applies to usury. , supra § 7, n. 33. Every Judge who borrows aught is ineligible to adjudicate the lawsuit of the owner of the lent object. This applies only when the Judge possesses naught to lend [to the latter], but if he had things to lend [to him],6Even if he did not lend him anything as yet, for since he has things to lend him, the borrowing does not constitute a bribe — M.E. he is fit [to adjudicate his case], since the latter too may borrow from him.7Yad ibid. par. 4. Derived from Ket. 105b: ‘Rabbah b. R. Shilah said: Any Judge who is wont to borrow is ineligible to adjudicate a lawsuit (for the owner of the lent object). This applies only when he possessed naught to lend to others, but if he has things to lend it does not matter. But is this really so? Did not Raba borrow things from the household of Bar Merion though they borrowed naught from him? — There he desired to make them feel important (i.e., the borrowing was not for his own benefit). Gloss: [This, viz., that the Judge who borrows is forbidden to pronounce judgment for the owner of the lent objcet applies] only when he is in the habit of borrowing from him, but [if the borowing is merely] incidental, and it is not evident that he does [this] on account of the [lender's] lawsuit, it is not [forbidden].8MaHaRIK Rt. 16 — G. Since we compare the prohibition of bribes to that of usury, we likewise learn that a gift constitutes a bribe only when it is clearly evident that it was given for that purpose. , B.M. 75b: ‘It has been taught: R. Simeon b. Yoḥai stated: Whence is it derived that if one is his neighbour’s creditor for a Maneh, the latter must not extend a greeting to him if he was not in the habit of doing this? — From the Biblical verse, Usury of any word which may be usury (Deut. XXIII, 20), — even speech is prohibited.’ Thus we see that it is forbidden only when the debtor was not in the habit of extending a greeting to the creditor, for then it is clearly evident that the purpose of the greeting is on account of the loan he received. But if it was his usual practice to extend a greeting, we consider the debtor’s greeting as of a mere incidental nature. Cf. B.M. 64b, Tosaf. s.v. אבל חצר. Similarly in the present case. If the Judge was in the habit of borrowing, he is forbidden to adjudicate the case of the lender, but if he borrowed from him by mere chance, and it is not evident that the owner of the lent object does it on account of his lawsuit, the prohibition does not stand.",

It must be clearly evident that the claimant sends the gift not on account of his lawsuit, but rather because it is his usual practice to send the Judge gifts — A.H. unless the Judge desires to refrain from [adjudicating] that lawsuit out of piety,11Geonic Responsum cited by Tur. Ket. 105b: ‘A man once brought to R. Anan a bale of small fish living among the reeds in the swamps. What are you doing here, the latter inquired of him? I have a lawsuit, the other answered. (R. Anan) did not accept it from him. I am ineligible to try your suit. I do not require, the other said to him, your decision (in the case) ; accept (the gift) so as not to restrain me from offering my first-fruit? (v. Ex. XXIII, 19). For it was taught: And there came a man from Baal-shalishah and brought the man of G-d bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of corn in his sack (II Kings IV, 42) ; but was Elisha (who was not a Kohen. , Pes. 68a and Asheri a.l.) permitted to eat first-fruit? — This was meant to inform you that one who brings a gift to a scholar is regarded as if he had offered first-fruits. I had no intention to accept your gift (R. Anan) replied to him, but now that you have given me a reason, I will accept it. He then sent him to R. Naḥman to whom he sent (the following message), Will the Master adjudicate (the lawsuit of) this man, for I, Anan, am ineligible to act as Judge for him.’ Legally, R. Anan was not disqualified to act as Judge since the gift was given to him before the writ of summons was sent to the other litigant, and the reason that he refused to act as Judge was an added stringency out of piety. , Tosaf. a.l. s.v. לא and San. 8a, Tosaf. s.v. פסילנא. Cf. supra § 7, n. 33. MaHaRDaK writes that it is considered a measure of piety to refuse to act in such a case only if the donor gave his gift not in the presence of the fellow-litigant, but if this was done in the latter’s presence, it is legally forbidden for the Judge to try the lawsuit, for under the circumstances the arguments or pleas of the defendant will become closed (נםתתמו טענותיו) — M.E., ShaK. e.g., where [the Judge] knows that he has become well disposed towards this [donor].12Tur — G. And even if the Judge did not become well disposed towards him, only that he has a feeling that the claimant sent him the gift on account of the lawsuit, the Judge is legally forbidden to sit in judgment (BaḤ) — P.Tesh.",

    "text_en": "One who takes payment to act as a Judge, all the judgments that he pronounced are void,21Mishna Bek. IV, 6(29a): ‘If a man takes payment to act as a Judge, his judgments are void.’ Gemara: ‘How do we know this? — Rab Judah stated on the authority of Rab: The Biblical verse says, Behold I have taught you etc., (Deut. IV, 5). Just as I teach gratuitously, so must you teach gratuitously. It was likewise taught thus: Scripture states: Even as the Lord my G-d commanded me (ibid.) — (i.e.,) just as I teach gratuitously, so must you teach gratuitously.’ Tosef (Z). Bek. III, 8: ‘One who is suspected (החשוד) of taking payment and (then) judges; (or taking payment) and (then) gives evidence, all the judgments that he pronounced and all the evidences that he gave are void.’ Cf. also Y. San. I, 1(18b) beg. Thus also RaN to Kid. II end, since the Mishna ibid. states ‘his judgments’ (דיניו) and not ‘his judgment’ (דינו). In the light of these sources we may say that not only where we know for certain that he received payment for pronouncing judgment, but also with respect to those regarding which we may entertain a suspicion that payment was taken by the Judge, we rule that they are null and void. Hence, it follows that where we know for certain that the Judge did not take payment for his decision, the judgment is binding. BaḤ writes that if the Judge took payment for adjudication, legally he does not have to return the money. It is only when he received money as a bribe that he is obliged to return it, for in the latter case an explicit Biblical principle has been transgressed (v. supra par. 1). Others maintain contra BaḤ that even when accepted as payment, it must be returned — P.Tesh. The judgments are regarded as void only from the moment we discover that the Judge took payment to act as Judge, for we say that only now has his status been impaired — Nethiboth. The adopted practice for both parties to give the Judge aught prior to the pronouncement of judgment dates back to former times when a communal measure was in vogue, enacted originally for the maintenance of the Judges. Hence, even nowadays when a Rabbi or Judge is appointed by a community it is as though a stipulation were made with the community to pay something to the Judge to pronounce judgment, since this was the original custom — Nethiboth. The other Judges of the Court are not disqualified on account of the Judge who took payment to pronounce judgment. Furthermore, his decision are null and void only with respect to discretionary judgment (שודא דדייני), i.e., where the Judges use their discretion to which of the litigants to adjudicate the claim, but not in the case where an explicit law is involved — P.Tesh. unless it is known that [in certain cases] he did not take payment [to act as Judge].22e., that particular decision is binding, although he took payment for other judgments before or after this. This should not be compared to the case of one who transgressed a Biblical injunction where the law is that all his judgments and evidences are void until he repents, for here it is different since he did not transgress any Biblical principle and the fact that his judgments or evidences are regarded void is merely a penalty imposed by the Sages — M.E. Cf. previous note. However, if he takes payment only [to compensate] the loss of his [regular] work, it is permissible, provided it is clearly evident to all that he takes payment only [to compensate] the loss of his [regular] work, e.g., where he [the Judge] has special work to execute at the time that he has to act as Judge23Ket. 105a in the case of Karna who received compensation for loss of work that could be ascertained since he was engaged in smelling tests at wine stores for which he was paid a fee. Similarly, in connection with R. Huna a.l. [and]24Thus M.E. says to the litigants [before acting as their Judge], 'Give me payment for work [as compensation for my] specific occupation from which I will have to desist [during the adjudication of the lawsuit].'25This law holds good if the Judge made this stipulation before he tries the case, but not if he demands compensation for loss of work after pronouncing judgment. In the latter case he may receive only as much as a labourer in that line would ask for stopping work in which he was engaged (which would be less than he would earn by working), as in the case of one who returns a lost article (v. infra § 264; § 265; Y.D. § 177; § 312) — M.E. TaZ disagrees with M.E. and holds that if no stipulation was made at the outset, he is not entitled even to compensation given for an idle labourer, for the litigant may say, ‘Had I known this, I would have taken my lawsuit to another Judge who would not have to interrupt his work.’ Thus also Tummim and Nethiboth. Shebuth Ya‘akob agrees with M.E. [Furthermore,] this [is permissible only] where he [the Judge] receives [payment] from both [litigants] in equal shares.26Ket. ibid., where it is stated that Karna took equal shares from both litigants. Cf. Yad, Sanhedrin XXIII, 5 and Kesef Mishneh a.l. according to whom this is also derived from Ket. ibid. in connection with R. Huna who ‘used to say (to the litigants), Provide me with one who will draw water (to irrigate my fields) in my stead, and I will pronounce judgment for you.’ Hence, he must have spoken to both litigants. But if it not clearly evident [that he takes payment as compensation for loss of his work] e.g., where he has no special work [to execute],27Thus Tur and Asheri in Resp. only that he says [to the litigants], 'Perhaps profit will accrue to me [while adjudicating your lawsuit] by purchasing goods [for trading, or through] brokerage,' and on account of this [possible profit] he demands payments [from the litigants], it is forbidden.28 infra § 34, 18 — G where the same ruling applies to giving evidence and cf. supra n 21. ShaK on the authority of BaḤ writes that it is permissible to take payment for arbitration. If he has a specific occupation or he is a skilled worker, although when the litigants come to him with their lawsuit he is unemployed, nevertheless, ex post facto the decision holds good — M.E. If the Judge has to travel to another locality in order to try a case, he is permitted to set his fee for travelling expenditures for this does not constitute payment for acting as a Judge. Likewise, even if the Judge is obliged to go to another home to try a case, he is permitted to receive payment for his trouble — A.H. The entire ruling here has reference to Judges who were not permanently appointed by the community; but those who were appointed to act as permanent Judges are permitted to take equal shares of payment from the litigants. This is the prevailing custom. , supra n. 21",

For it is said, From a false matter keep far.’ but he should say to him in a respectful manner, 'Master, so and so you have taught me.'33Cf. the following sources: San. 99b: On the meaning of Epikoros who according to the Mishna (ibid. 90a) has no portion in the world to come, it is stated: ‘E.g., one who was sitting before his master when the discussion was directed to some other subject, and the disciple said, We said thus on the matter, instead of, Thou master has said.’ Hence, we see that it is proper for the disciple to make his statement in a respectful manner so as to give credit to his master and not to himself. Ibid. 80b-81a: ‘Samuel said to Rab Judah: You keen scholar, do not speak to your father thus (i.e., to distinctly tell him that he erred). For it has been taught: If one was (unintentionally) transgressing a precept of the Torah, his son should not say, Father you transgressed a Biblical precept, but say… Father, the following verse is written in the Torah’ (by stating the verse indirectly his father will not be put to shame). Hence, this applies much more so in the case of his master, because the accepted principle is that respect for one’s teacher takes precedence over respect for one’s father (v. B.M. 33a). Ḥag. 14b: ‘(R. Eleazar b. ‘Arak) said to him (R. Joḥanan b. Zakkai) : Master, permit me to say something before you which you have taught me.’ From the exposition that follows it appears that this was a novel interpretation that he had not heard from R. Joḥanan b. Zakkai. Nevertheless, it is a sign of respect that when one states something before his master, he should say, You have taught me. , additional references in W.G. and cf.

(Whence that one is to appear) before a distinguished personage? — For it is written, Before the Lord (ibid. v. 16). (That both parties should be named) thou and So-and-so? — For it is written, Thou and they (that are with them) and Aaron (ibid. v. 16). That we appoint a time? — For it is written, Tomorrow (ibid.). One term and then another term (after one more term) ? — They called there, Pharaoh the king of Egypt, (the cause of) commotion; he hath let the appointed time pass by; (As I live, saith the King, the Lord of Hosts, surely like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come) (Jer. XLVI, 17-18. , Rashi and Targum a.l.)’ That he is placed under the ban only after the third summons is derived from Tosaf. a.l., s.v. מתרינן in accord with the opinion of ‘some explain.’ Thus also Tur. Cf. also B.K. 113a: ‘R. Ḥisda said: (In a legal summons) we appoint a time for the person to appear) on Monday, (then) on Thursday, and (then) on (the following) Monday (The Beth Din held its sessions on Mondays and Thursdays — B.K. 82a), (i.e.,) one term and then another term after one more term (in case of failing to appear) and on the morrow (of the last fixed) we write (the Pethiḥa).’ , supra § 8, 5, n. 45. The defendant has a right to say to the claimant before appearing in Court, ‘Tell me the nature of your claim,’ and if the claimant refuses to comply with his request, the defendant can say, ‘I will not go to Court with you until you tell me, for it is quite possible that when I hear your claim I will settle with you and indemnify you’ — ShaK contra Be’er Sheba. In the latter case, the defendant should report the claimant’s refusal to disclose the nature of his claim to the Court messenger — A.H. The expenses for the summons should be defrayed by the claimant and not by the defendant — ShaK. The claimant can summon the defendant to appear only on the days that Court sessions are held according to the adopted custom of the community unless the local usage is to hold a Court session whenever the need arises. The writ of summons, however, may be sent to the defendant at any time for it has no fixed time — M.E. When does this apply? — In [the case of one] who was in country towns and departs from and returns to [the city],2For there may have been unavoidable circumstances which prevented the defendant from appearing after the first two summonses were sent. Where, however, he does not habitually depart from and return to the city, only that he spends a week or two away from home in the country towns or villages, it seems that he does not come under this ruling, and they appoint a time for him to appear for trial in accordance with his preoccupation — M.E. but [in the case of one] who is usually in the city, only one date is fixed for him [in a legal summons],3Thus Tur and Yad, Sanhedrin XXV, 8, derived from B.K. 113a: ‘R. Assi happened to be at R. Kahana’s and saw that a certain woman was summoned to appear before the Court on the preceding evening (and when she failed to appear) he wrote a Pethiḥa against her on the following morning. He then said to R. Kahana: Does not the Master hold the opinion of R. Ḥisda (v. supra n. 1)… He replied: This has reference only to a man who might be prevented by an unavoidable interference, through being out of town, but a woman who is (always) in town and if she fails to appear, is regarded contumacious (after the first act of refusal).’ The adopted custom nowadays is to send three summonses even for one who is in town (Tummim, Nethiboth) — P.Tesh. and if he did not appear on that entire day, they place him under the ban on the morrow.4Yad ibid. has לערב ‘in the evening.’ , infra par. 3. Gloss: [If] the [members of the] Court went to another place, he [the defendant] is required to go after them [in order to be tried before them], and if he did not go, they place him under the ban.5B.Yos. — G. Tur and Yad do not state this law and on the basis of the Mishna in R.H. 31b [‘should the Head of the Court be in another place, the witnesses (who give evidence for the New Moon) should still go only to the place of Assembly (and the Court declares the sanctification of the New Moon without the Head’)], R. Moses Ibn Ḥabib in his Shamoth ba-Areẓ rejects the present ruling of Isserles. For the law (R.H. ibid.) rests with R. Ashi that all laws are comparable in this respect to the sanctification of the New Moon, contra Amemar (ibid.) who distinguishes between the sanctification of the New Moon and other laws, because in the former case, the witnesses would refrain from giving evidence were we to insist that they go to the place of the Head, but in other cases, the borrower is a servant to the lender (Prov. XXII, 7). Hence, since the law rests with R. Ashi, Isserles’ ruling must be rejected. Other authorities defend Isserles — P.Tesh. According to A.H., Isserles’ ruling would apply only in a case where the defendant does not live in the same locality as the Judge, and if the Judge or the Court are in a different locality now, and the defendant, who was originally summoned to appear for trial in the first place, is not any further away from the second place, he must appear, otherwise he is placed under the ban. The Court messenger is relied upon to state,6 supra § 8, 5, nn. 44-45. In all the following cases we place the recalcitrant defendant under the ban. '[The defendant] behaved insolently towards me7Kid. 70b. , supra § 8, 5, nn. 44-45. or towards the Judge8Kid. 70a., and Rashi s.v. שמתיה. Cf. supra § 7, n. 32. or refused to appear for trial,'6 supra § 8, 5, nn. 44-45. In all the following cases we place the recalcitrant defendant under the ban. and they decree the Shammeta,9Heb. שמתא i.e., ‘an imprecation,’ used loosely as the equivalent of the Heb. נידוי ,חרם or the Aram. אחרמתא. Niddui and Ḥerem are Mishnaic terms while Shammeta was used in Babylon. The legal signification of these terms is discussed in Ned. 7a-b and later in Geonic literature. According to Rashi, Shammeta is less severe than Niddui. Maim. Yad, Talmud Torah VII, 2 maintains that they are identical. N in Mishpat ha-Ḥerem claims that Shammeta is a general term for Niddui and Ḥerem. Cf. Lewin B.M. in Oẓar ha-Geonim IV, on Mashkin, Responsa § 29ff, pp. 17-19.

The messenger of Court is not held responsible in reporting [this] information on grounds of slander.12 supra § 8, 5, n. 46. Gloss: One who states that he is not afraid of the Court order or the Sage, — [the law is that] although he does appear in Court [for trial], they place him under the ban, for since he states that he comes not on account of the [Court] order, it is regarded as contempt of the law.13M.K. 16a: ‘This (viz., that warning is given three times) applies only if he disregards a monetary case, but for contempt of the law (אפקרותא) the ban is pronounced forthwith.’ , Y.D. § 334, [par. 43]. If he stated, 'I do not wish to be tried before you, only before another Court,' v., infra § 14.14Cf. supra § 3. One who is not able to come to Court because he is required to go to distant countries, should inform the Court thereof, and make excuses [for the postponement of the trial] and request another date [for the hearing], and if he did not do [this] they place him under the ban, although he was not able to come.15MaHaRIK Rt. 11 — G. Derived from B.K. 112b: ‘Raba said: The law is that we may authenticate a document (either by oral evidence or by comparing the signatures) even not in the presence of one of the litigants… and even if he complains aloud before us (that the document was forged). But if he says: Give me time until I produce witnesses and invalidate the document, we give him time. If he comes (with witnesses), then he comes; but if he does not come we wait for him (the following) Monday and Thursday and Monday. If he still does not come we write a Pethiḥa against him (that goes into effect after) ninety days. For the first thirty days we do not go down (to take possession of his property) since we say that he is busy trying to borrow money; during the following thirty days we likewise do not go down to take possession of his property, as we say perhaps he was unable to raise a loan and is trying to sell his property; the last thirty days we likewise do not go down to take possession of his property since we may still say that the purchaser (of his property) is busy himself trying to raise money. If he still does not come (after all this), we write an Adrakta (legal permission to a creditor to trace the debtor’s property for the purpose or having it seized, assessed, offered for public sale and eventually delivered to him) on his property.’ Hence, we see that although he is unavoidably prevented from producing witnesses in which case we give him time to bring proof, yet, he must appear before Court to justify the delay; otherwise, the ban is decreed against him. Cf. also ibid. 113a: ‘Raba said: If a Pethiḥa was written against a recalcitrant offender for not coming before Court, we do not destroy it so long as he does not come before the Court… this however, is not so; for as soon as he states his intention to obey, we must destroy the Pethiḥa.’ One who accepted [to be tried before] a Court of two by making an agreement by means of a Kinyan,16Heb. קנין. Symbolical for making an agreement binding by handing over an object from one to the other of the contracting parties. In the present ruling should there be no agreement by symbol, the defendant may retract. , infra § 22,  and they summoned him and he did not appear, — [the law is that] they [have the power to] place him under the ban as17Thus reading of M.E. (Cur edd. have בבייד ‘in a Court of etc.’). e., although the agreement by symbol was made only before two Judges, nevertheless, they have the right to decree the ban against him as a Court of three — M.E. a Court of three.18B.Yos. on the authority of RaShBA Resp. — G.",

Cf. source of this ruling in n. 23 infra. and [the defendant] refused to come, — [the law is that] they do not write against him a warrant of excommunication20 supra par. 1 and notes. Actually even without writing the warrant of excommunication we do not place the defendant under the ban unless the statements conflict, i.e., if the Court messenger says that he summoned the defendant in the name of the three Judges and the latter denies this in which case we place the defendant under the ban but do not write a warrant (Pethiḥa). , supra § 8, 5, n. 45. until he [the messenger] states [this] in the name of the three [Judges].

III — G. , M.K. 16a and supra par. 1, n. 1.

This ruling, furthermore, applies even if the Judge is not a recognized authority (מומחה לרבים) — Nethiboth. When does this apply? — Where the [Court] messenger went [to summon the defendant] on an [ordinary] day that is not known [to be appointed] for a judicial session, but [if] on the day that is known [to be appointed as a Court-day] when the Judges sit in judgment, everyone knows that all the Judges are assembled [at their meeting place] and although the [Court] messenger came [to summon the defendant] in the name of one [Judge],22Provided he was equal and not inferior to the other two Judges in learning — ShaK on the authority of RaShaL. it is as though he came in the name of the three [Judges].23Yad, Sanhedrin XXV, 7. Derived from San. 8a: ‘For Raba said: When three Judges sit in judgment and the Court messenger went and served the summons in the name of one only, his statement is void, until he stated it in the name of all the (three Judges). This, however, has reference only to an ordinary day; but on a Court-day (i.e., Mondays and Thursdays. , B.K. 82a) it is not necessary.’ A.H. writes that it is only when the Court has fixed days during which judicial sessions are held that it is not necessary to summon the defendant in the name of all the Judges, for since there is a set time for the Judges to sit in judgment, the defendant knows that all the Judges are in session; but if judicial sessions are conducted every day, the Court messenger must summon him in the name of all the Judges (or in the name of the recognized authority). Otherwise the defendant may state that ‘since the Court messenger summoned me in the name of one Judge, I thought that the other Judges were not in session today.’ A.H. also states that there are some localities where the Court messenger summons the defendant in the name of the litigant as follows : ‘So-and-so summons you to appear in Court.’",

    "text_en": "One who is [a resident] in a city24Heb. מדינה. Lit. ‘a province.’ However, Maim., on the basis of numerous Talmudic references employs this term in the sense of ‘a large city’ — M.E. and the Court messenger went [to convey to him a legal summons] and did not find him [at home] — [the law is that] they do not fix for him a time [to appear in Court] until the [Court] messenger finds him and informs him thereof.25For even if the neighbours were informed thereof they will think that perhaps the messenger met him and informed him himself. , Gloss at the end of this ruling which has reference to this law, and cf. infra n. 30. [If] he was in a country town [away from home], — [then] if it is customary for him to come [home] on that very same day, the [Court] messenger may say even to one of the neighbours [of the defendant], even [if it be] a woman, 'If So-and-so comes [home today] inform him that the Court of Law has fixed a time for him, [viz.,] that he appear today in the Court of Law;'26For we presume that they carried out their commission — Nethiboth. and if he does not come [to Court] they place him under the ban in the evening.27Thus Yad, Sanhedrin XXV, 10. However, in Yad ibid., par. 8, Maim. in stating the law, a) of one who was in the city (בעיר) and did not appear in Court after receiving a legal summons, has ‘לערב,’ i.e., he is placed under the ban the very same day in the evening; yet, in the same par., when stating the law of one who was in a country town (בכפרים) and did not appear in Court even after the third summons, Maim., has ‘עד למחר,’ i.e., he is placed under the ban only on the morrow. On the other hand, Caro has both in a) and b) למחרתו, i.e., on the morrow and in the present ruling has לערב in the evening. The following explanation is advanced in order to remove the apparent discrepancy. In Yad ibid., par. 8, both in a) and b), we are informed that the party is not placed under the ban before the end of the day. In a) לערב (in the evening) is used, i.e., the beginning of the following day; in b) עד לערב (on the morrow) is used, i.e., the morrow of the following day. The reason why Maim. uses both terms is in order to teach us the remarkable feature of this law, viz., in a) where only one day is given to him to appear in Court, since he is in the city, consequently, we adopt a stringency and pronounce the ban at the beginning of the following day, i.e., ‘in the evening;’ in b) where he departs from and returns to the city in which case we give the defendant three terms, we adopt a leniency and give him time until the morning of the following day. Hence, the term עד למחר (until the morrow). Since, therefore, legally there is no difference, for both terms refer to the next day, Tur has only למחרתו ‘on the morrow,’ and he is followed by Caro in rulings a) and b), who also has למחרתו. It is quite possible however, that in par. 1 supra, Caro also holds that the ban is pronounced in the evening, but the reason he mentions למחרתו (on the morrow) is merely to inform us that on the morrow they publicize the fact that the defendant had been placed under the ban on the preceding evening, and in our present ruling, Caro simply states the law of decreeing the ban in the evening following Maim. — M.E. , however, W.G. and Be’er Eliyahu a.l. for further comments. And so much the more [if he was summoned] by the Court messenger [himself], although he [the Court messenger] did not return [to Court] and state, 'I have carried out my commission.'28Tur — G. For we might have thought that if he does not return to the Court of Law to inform them that he had carried out their commission there is the possibility that the party was not informed thereof — M.E. When does this apply [viz., that we place him under the ban]? — Where [it is known that] he [the defendant on returning home] via the route that he is accustomed to take, does not [pass] by the locality of the Court of Law; but if his route [goes] by them [viz., the members of the Court of Law], they do not place him under the ban until the [Court] messenger himself conveys [the summons] to him, for fear that the neighbours had not informed him thereof, for they might think [that since] his route [passes] by the door of the Court of Law, he had already passed by them29Thus Yad. [and the summons was conveyed to him] and [then] he left. Likewise, if he did not arrive in the city until the next day, we do not rely upon the neighbours, for fear that they forgot and did not inform him thereof. Gloss: So too, if he was in the city, we do not rely upon the neighbours, since they might think that perhaps the Court messenger found him and had [already] conveyed [the summons] to him.30Tur — G. The entire ruling here is found in Yad, Sanhedrin XXV, 10, derived from B.K. 112b-113a: ‘Rabina said: We may serve a legal summons through the mouth of a woman or through the mouth of neighbours; this applies only to a case where the (defendant) was then not in town, but if he was at that time in town, it is not so, for it is possible that they (i.e., the woman or the neighbours or according to A.H. this has reference even to the defendant’s wife and children) might not convey the summons to him, thinking that the Court messenger will find him and transmit it to him. Furthermore, this ruling applies only when the party would not be passing by the Court of Law, but if he should have to pass by the door of the Court of Law, this is not so, since they (i.e., the woman or the neighbours) might think that at the Court of Law they will find him first and convey the summons to him. Again, this applies only if the party was due home on the very same day, but if he does not come home on the same day, it is not so, because we say that they surely forgot it completely.’ Isserles’ Gloss here is merely stated for the purpose of adducing the Talmudic reason for not relying on the neighbours in the case where the defendant was a resident in a city, and refers to the first part of Caro’s ruling. Otherwise, this Gloss would be redundant since the term מדינה employed in Yad (and followed here by Caro) also means עיר (i.e., a city) — M.E. Cf. supra n. 25.",

    "text_en": "When two [litigants] appear before you for trial, one weak [in influence], the other powerful [in influence], so long as you have not heard their pleas or [even after you have heard their pleas, — [so long as] you are in doubt which way the judgment will incline, you may say to them, 'I am not bound to try your case,' lest the one of powerful [influence] be pronounced guilty and persecute the Judge.1Thus Tosaf. (v. infra n. 3) ; Alfasi; BeHaG; She’iltoth, Mishpatim s. 58. Derived from Y. San. I, 1(18b); Sifre to Deut. I, 17; Tanḥuma, Mishpatim s. 6; Tosef (Ẓ). Sanhedrin I, 7. However, if you have [already] heard their pleas, and you know which way the judgment will incline,2 infra n. 3. Derived from Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man (for the judgment is G-d’s) (Deut. I, 17). The last part of this verse, for the judgment is G-d’s, refers to the ‘conclusion of the trial.’ Judgment (משפט) has reference to the time when the Judge knows which way the judgment will incline (v. supra § 5, n. 17 — M.E. Cf. however, TaZ a.l. you may not say [to them], 'I am not bound to try your case.'3Yad, Sanhedrin XXII,  Derived from San. 6b: ‘When two men appear before you for trial, one weak (in influence), the other strong (in influence), before you have listened to their pleas, or even after, as long as you are in doubt which way the judgment will incline (i.e., in whose favour the verdict will be rendered), you may say to them: “I am not bound to render a decision in your case,” lest the one of strong influence be pronounced guilty and persecute the Judge (Thus Tosaf. But Rashi explains: He will pursue the Judge to have the judgment reversed in his favour). However, if you have already heard their pleas and know which way the judgment will incline, you cannot say to them: “I am not bound to render a decision in your case,” for it is written, Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man (Deut. I, 17).’ , supra n. 2. Regarding one of the Judges who wishes to withdraw from the case, v. infra § 18, 4. And if he was appointed [to serve as Judge] for the public, he is obliged to try their case.4Thus Yad, ibid. Because the entire community will protect him. This has reference even to a case where the Judge had not yet heard the pleas of the litigants, or even if he did hear the pleas but is in doubt which way the judgment will incline, — yet, since he was appointed by the public he is bound to try the case; whereas one who is not an appointed Judge may withdraw under these conditions. Cf. the following sources which substantiate this ruling: Sifre to Deut. I, 16: ‘And I charged your judges at that time saying: Hear the causes between your brethren etc. — In former days you possessed your own authority; from now on you are slaves and subject to the community.’ Sifre to Deut. I, 17: ‘Lest you say, I am afraid of So-and-so who might put my son to death, or might set my stack of grain on fire, or might cut down my young trees, — the text reads, Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man. And so too, does it state with regards to Jehoshaphat, and he said to the judges: Consider what ye do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord (II Chron. XIX, 6).’ The expression I am afraid of So-and-so etc., indicates that we deal here with a case where one of the litigants is of powerful influence, but since the Judges were appointed they could not withdraw froom the case. W.G., however, disagrees with Caro’s ruling, viz., that in the case of an appointed Judge he may not withdraw even if he did not hear the case or even if he did hear the case, but is in doubt which way the judgment will incline, where the litigants are of unequal influence. For even in the case of an appointed Judge, W.G. maintains that it is only after he has heard the pleas and knows which way the judgment will incline that he cannot withdraw. And as to the above text in Sifre, ‘In former days (i.e., prior to your appointment as Judges),’ — it has reference even to a case where both litigants were of strong influence at which time you could withdraw before you heard the pleas, or where you had heard the pleas but were in doubt as to the verdict, — for even in such a case there is still the possibility that the litigant who will be pronounced guilty, might harass the Judge, but where only one of the litigants is of strong influence, even an appointed Judge is permitted to withdraw before the pleas are heard etc. Appointed Judges are subject to the community and cannot withdraw save where both litigants are of powerful influence. Furthermore, the text in San. ibid. which also adduces the Biblical verse, Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man, addressed to appointed Judges, found in Sifre ibid., — clearly states that we deal with a case where one litigant was of weak and the other of strong influence and only before the pleas are heard can the Judge wihtdraw. It follows therefrom that the exposition in Sifre ibid., ‘Lest you say etc.,’ also deals with similar circumstances. Hence, W.G. would not agree with Isserles’ Gloss anon. Cf. also Hag. Asheri to San. III who State the case of Mar ‘Ukba who refused to act as Judge (although he was an appointed Judge. v. Shab. 55a) in a case where he knew that the litigants will not accept his decision (v. San. 29a), which is equivalent to a case where one litigant is of strong influence and the pleas had not been heard. In short, even an appointed Judge is not bound to try the case of strong and weak litigants prior to hearing the pleas or before he knows which way the judgment will incline. Gloss: So too, if they were both powerful [litigants] he is required to try their case.5Hag. Asheri to San. I beg. and B.Yos. on the authority of Tosaf. — G. The reason being, that if the one pronounced guilty will harass the Judge, the other litigant will come to his aid (Tosaf. ibid.) — ShaK. This, of course means even if he is not an appointed Judge. , however, supra n. 4, opinion of W.G. There is, however, an [authority] who writes that at present it is nevertheless the adopted practice not to interfere with violators [of the law] because there is danger in [this] matter lest he [the violator] get him into trouble with the government.6MaHaRIW — G. This means even if both litigants are of powerful influence. , however, D.M. where the order of Isserles’ Gloss is a) not to interfere with violators etc., and then b) the ruling regarding two litigants of powerful influence. Cf. Kid. 71a the case of R. Phineas where we find that if powerful individuals might endanger one’s life, one should refrain from admonishing them. A.H. writes that they may withdraw even at the conclusion of the trial even if they are permanent Judges only if there is danger. If a Judge sees that his other two colleagues (who are incompetent) are perverting justice, he may, when requested to give his legal opinion in the matter, say, ‘I know not the law in this case,’ as a result of which other Judges will be co-opted to form a majority against the incompetent Judges (v. Mishna San. V, 5). This is permissible in the interests of peace (Tummim, Nethiboth) — P.Tesh.",

    "text_en": "It is a religious duty to say to the litigants at the outset, 'Do you wish [to resort to] law or [to submit to] arbitration?' If they consented [to submit to] arbitration, they bring about a settlement between them.7Yad, Sanhedrin XXII, 4. Derived from San. 6b-7a: ‘R. Joshua b. Korḥa states : Arbitration is a religious duty, for it is written, Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates (Zech. VIII, 16). Certainly where there is (the execution of) justice, there is no peace, and where there is peace, there is no (execution of) justice! But what is that kind of justice that is accompanied by peace? — You must admit: Arbitration (because the rigid application of the law does not necessarily set the contesting parties at peace). And so too, in the case of David it says, And David executed justice and righteousness (charity) towards all his people (II Sam. VIII, 15)… But what is that kind of justice that is accompanied by righteousness? — You must admit: Arbitration… Rab stated: The adopted ruling (Halachah) agrees with R. Joshua b. Korḥa… and it is a religious duty to ask the litigants whether they desire to resort to law or to submit to arbitration.’ Consequently, since it is a religious duty to arbitrate, the Judge should make this clear to the litigants in order that they consent to submit to arbitration. The meaning of Caro’s text, therefore, is: — If you wish to resort to law I will act as your Judge; if not, then know ye that arbitration is preferable because it is a religious duty — M.E. And just as [the Judge] is cautioned not to pervert judgment, so too, is he cautioned not to direct the arbitration [in favour of] one party more than the other.8Thus Tur. Derived from San. 32b: ‘It has been taught: Justice, justice shalt thou follow (Deut. XVI, 20); the first (mention of justice) has reference to a verdict based on strict law; the second, to arbitration.’ , Rashi a.l., s.v. אבל קראי who writes that the second mention of justice means that the Judge should justify the arbitration according to what he sees with his own eyes. R.A.Eger states that just as in the case of strict law, if the Judge perverts justice through error, he must reconsider the case and retract from his former decision, so too, in bringing about an arbitration. Shebuth Ya‘akob reports the following case: A and B consented to submit their case to arbitration and entered into same by symbolic agreement (קנין), A contests the legality of the decision on the following grounds: a) According to strict law, A was obliged to take a number of oaths in order to justify himself in the eyes of the Court. When the matter was submitted to arbitration, it was ruled that A be exempt from the imposition of an oath on condition that he pay instead a certain amount of money. A, however, claims that B too, was originally obliged to take a number of oaths, — yet, in the latter case the arbitrator did not decide that he be exempt therefrom by paying money instead. In addition, A claims that certain oaths were overlooked entirely. b) The original agreement upon submitting the case to arbitration referred only to the elimination of oaths, but not to any other part of the case. However, according to the decision of the arbitrator, the settlement took into account the case as a whole. Hence, A contends that the entire decision is invalid. Responsum: Argument a) is not valid because undoubtedly the arbitrators have their reasons for acting thus only with respect to the oaths that A was required to take. Argument b), however, is a valid one and consequently, it must be reconsidered. We do not apply the principle that since one of the argument is valid then the whole case should be reconsidered. Should A, however, show that one argument depends upon the other, there is the possibility that the entire case must be reconsidered, but this must first be clearly established before invalidating the decision. Where the Judge is requested to arbitrate a case and render a decision that would be related to strict law (פשרה קרובה לדין), the law is that not more than one third less than the amount the defendant would have to pay according to strict law, is regarded a valid settlement in such a case. E.g., if according to strict law he would have to pay 300 dollars, then 200 dollars would be regarded as a valid settlement — P.Tesh. Every Court of Law that always brings about a settlement is considered praiseworthy.7Yad, Sanhedrin XXII, 4. Derived from San. 6b-7a: ‘R. Joshua b. Korḥa states : Arbitration is a religious duty, for it is written, Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates (Zech. VIII, 16). Certainly where there is (the execution of) justice, there is no peace, and where there is peace, there is no (execution of) justice! But what is that kind of justice that is accompanied by peace? — You must admit: Arbitration (because the rigid application of the law does not necessarily set the contesting parties at peace). And so too, in the case of David it says, And David executed justice and righteousness (charity) towards all his people (II Sam. VIII, 15)… But what is that kind of justice that is accompanied by righteousness? — You must admit: Arbitration… Rab stated: The adopted ruling (Halachah) agrees with R. Joshua b. Korḥa… and it is a religious duty to ask the litigants whether they desire to resort to law or to submit to arbitration.’ Consequently, since it is a religious duty to arbitrate, the Judge should make this clear to the litigants in order that they consent to submit to arbitration. The meaning of Caro’s text, therefore, is: — If you wish to resort to law I will act as your Judge; if not, then know ye that arbitration is preferable because it is a religious duty — M.E. When does this apply?9San. 6b: ‘When do we regard a legal decision as rendered (so that arbitration is no longer permitted) ? — Rab Judah on the authority of Rab states: (When they say) : So-and-so you are guilty; So-and-so you are not guilty.’ — Before the conclusion of the trial, — even though one has heard their pleas and knows which way the judgment will incline, — it is a religious duty to attempt a settlement;10San. 6b-7a in agreement with the First Tanna contra R. Simeon b. Manasya. Caro’s ruling accords with the interpretation of Rashi, San. 6b, s.v. נגמר הדין contra Tosaf. Cf. infra n. 11. Suggesting a settlement is not regarded as deception on the part of the Judge, since a man is willing to forego a certain part of his claim as long as everyone will be at peace — M.E. but after the Judge concluded the trial and made the pronouncement, 'So-and-so, you are innocent, So-and-so, you are guilty,' he is not permitted to attempt a settlement between them.11It is forbidden to say to one who was pronounced not guilty, ‘Make a settlement with the other party because I am afraid that I might have erred and the other Judges will reverse my decision’ — M.E. BaḤ agrees with Tosaf. contra Rashi (v. supra n. 10) that even before the pronouncement of the verdict, so long as the case has been thoroughly examined by the Judges, arbitration should not be proposed. ShaK opposes BaḤ, but the latter is defended by Bir. Yos., who shows that many other authorities agree with Tosaf. According to Tosaf., even if the Judge did not state to the guilty party, ‘Go and pay him whatever you owe him,’ it is still considered the ‘conclusion of the trial’ (v. B.K. 69a, B.M. 17a s.v. חייב). SeMaG, however, regards the trial as concluded only after this statement is made — ShaK. According to Shilte Geborim, even after the conclusion of the trial, if the Judges inform the litigants concerning the nature of the settlement, and the latter agree to submit the case to arbitration, it is permissible, provided there was no coercion. Moreover, it is considered a meritorious act — ShaK. Many other authorities, however, oppose Shilte Giborim — P.Tesh. However, another person who is not a Judge is permitted to attempt a settlement between them,12B.Yos. on the authority of Agudah. , San. 6b where both the First Tanna and R. Simeon b. Manasya use the second person, viz., ‘When two come before you for judgment,’ whence it follows that you refers to a competent Judge, but another individual who is not a Judge, is permitted to attempt a settlement. Cf. also San. ibid.: ‘Aaron loved peace, pursued peace and made peace between man and man, as it is written, The law of truth was in his mouth, unrighteousness was not found in his lips, he walked with Me in peace and uprightness and did turn many away from iniquity’ (Mal. II, 6) and cf. Tosaf., a.l., s.v. אבל who explain that since Aaron was not a Judge, because all matters of a legal nature were brought before Moses, then for him arbitration was permissible. [provided] that this is not [attempted] in a Court sitting that is appointed for the purpose [of holding] legal [sessions].13RaShBA, Resp. on the authority of R. Hai Gaon. For whatever is done in the presence of the Judges is regarded as if it were carried out with the consent of the Judges — M.E. If the Court of Law imposed an oath upon one of them, the Court of Law is permitted to bring about a settlement between them [even after the conclusion of the trial],14Thus Tur. so that [the one who is bound to take an oath] should be exempt from the responsibility thereof.15San. 6b, Tosaf. s.v. נגמר הדין. The Court of Law cannot compel one to fall in with [the principle of equity, i.e., actting] beyond the requirements of the line of justice, although that would appear to them to be the proper thing [to do].16B.Yos. on the authority of R. Yeruḥam and Asheri — G. Cf. the following passages: B.K. 99b: ‘Rabbah b. Bar Ḥanah said on the authority of R. Joḥanan : An expert slaughterer who did not slaughter properly (as a result of which the animal became ritually unfit for consumption) is held responsible even if he was as skilled as the slaughterers of Sepphoris… Did not Rabbah b. Bar Ḥanah state that a similar case came before R. Joḥanan in the Synagogue of Maon and he said to the slaughterer, Go and bring proof that you are an expert to slaughter hens and I will exempt you? — There is no difficulty. The latter law (has reference to a slaughterer who worked) gratuitously; the former (where the slaughterer does it) for hire… A certain woman showed a Denar to R. Ḥiyya and he informed her that it was good. Subsequently, she came to him again and said to him, I showed it later (to others) and they informed me that it was bad, and I could not pass it. He then said to Rab, Go and exchange it for a good one … R. Ḥiyya (although he was an expert and needed no further instruction in this matter, and consequently, would be exempt) acted beyond the requirements of the line of justice, as R. Joseph learnt: And shalt show them (v. Ex. XVIII, 20) refers to their livelihood; the way refers to acts of lovingkindness; they must walk refers to visiting the sick; wherein refers to burial and the work refers to law; which they must do refers to (acting) beyond the requirements of the line of justice.’ , also B.M. 30b in the case of R. Ishmael b. R. Jose. Hence, we see that acting beyond the requirements of the law, although it is derived from a Biblical text, and in the eyes of the Judges it would be the proper thing to do, yet, it cannot be enforced by the Court of Law. Cf., however, B.M. 83a: ‘Some carriers (negligently) broke a barrel of wine that belonged to Rabbah b. R. Huna (Thus Alfasi. Cur. edd. : ‘b. Bar Ḥanan’). Thereupon he confiscated their cloaks; so they went and told Rab about it. Give them back their cloaks, said the latter. Is this the law, he asked. Yes, he answered, That thou mayest walk in the way of good men’ (Prov. II, 20). Hence, we may ask why this is not derived from the above-mentioned text? RI of Orleans in B.K. 100a, Tosaf s.v. יפנים explains that acting ‘beyond the requirements of the law’ has reference only to a) a case where others under the same circumstances would be liable to pay but not he, as in the case of R. Ḥiyya and R. Ishmael b. R. Jose mentioned above, whereas in b) a case where there is no distinction between him and others (i.e., everyone would be exempt) as in the case of Rabbah b. Bar Huna, such action is merely a case of That thou mayest walk in the way of good men. Consequently, in a) acting beyond the requirements of the law is considered Biblical, whereas in b) it is based on post-Mosaic tradition. Hence, our present ruling refers to a). Cf. also B.M. 24b and Tosaf. s.v. לפנים. There are thus three degrees of acting beyond the requirements of the law: a) where the responsibility is such that it does not even come within the purview of acting beyond the requirements of the law. Consequently, one who out of equity acts thus, walks in the way of good men. E.g., the carriers who negligently broke a barrel of wine belonging to Rabbah b. R. Huna who suffered damages; b) where everyone would be exempt and should not even come under the category of acting beyond the requirements of the law, but since no damage was caused as in a), one should act beyond the requirements of the law. E.g., the case of the ‘found asses’ in B.M. 24b (v. passage infra n. 17) ; c) where everyone else would be held responsible, in which case acting beyond the requirements of the law is based on a Pentateuchal text, although such action cannot be enforced. E.g., the case of R. Ḥiyya. Our present ruling refers to c). , also BaḤ for other interpretations. However, some differ with [this opinion].17Mord. to B.M. II, — G. Derived from B.M. 24b: ‘R. Judah once went after Mar Samuel in a street of whole meal dealers and asked him: What is the law if one found a purse here? — (Mar Samuel) answered: It belongs to the finder. What is the law if an Israelite came and produced an identification mark? — (Mar Samuel) answered: He would be required to return it. Both (views contradict each other)! — (Mar Samuel) answered: One should act beyond the requirements of the law. So too, the father of Samuel found asses in a desert and (yet) he returned them after a year of twelve months: he (acted) beyond the requirements of the law.’ In this passage, the expression ‘it belongs to the finder’ (הרי אלו שלו) indicates that legally it belongs to the finder. Consequently, the subsequent statement ‘he would be required to return it’ (חייב להחזיר) refers to doing one’s duty towards G-d. In addition the expression ‘he returned them etc.,’ (אהדרינהו למרייהו) indicates thhat he did this on his own. Moreover, he was only obliged to return their worth (v. Tosaf., B.M. ibid. s.v. לבתר). Derived also from the case of the ‘carriers’ (B.M. 83a. Cf. passage quoted supra n. 16), since it is not stated that they came before Rab for trial but rather ‘they went and told Rab about it,’ i.e., to use his influence by means of words of persuasion. Thus also Asheri to B.M. II who considers this a case of acting beyond the requirements of the law and cites the Biblical text which they must do (v. supra n. 16) and would be contra Tosaf. Hence, according to this opinion all cases of acting beyond the requirements of the law are similar and in all cases mentioned above we cannot compel anyone to act beyond the requirements of the law. The interpretation here follows W.G. and Be’er Eliyahu. , BaḤ for other interpretations.",

    "text_en": "It is permissible for the Court of Law to forgo [certain] rights in property belonging to orphans [provided this is carried out by a settlement] out of Court in order to set them at peace from [entering into future] disputes.18Thus Isserlein. Derived from B.K. 21a: ‘A certain man built a mansion on the ruins belonging to orphans. R. Naḥman confiscated the mansion from him… originally Carmanians (MS.M קדמאי; MS.R. and Rashi קדמונאי ‘old settlers’ or ‘nomads’) had been living on the abandoned property belonging to the orphans and had been paying a nominal rent (Hence the orphans suffered a loss however small it was). (When R. Naḥman) said to him, Go and make a peaceful settlement with the orphans, he paid no attention. R. Naḥman, therefore, confiscated the mansion from him.’ This shows that although legally the defendant was responsible in full, nevertheless, R. Naḥman suggested at first a peaceful settlement. Likewise, the legal guardian of the orphans may make a settlement on behalf of the orphans which would ultimately be advantageous to their welfare. He should, however, make the settlement in accordance with a recognized Court of Law — P.Tesh.",

Naḥman stated on the authority of Samuel: Orphans who came to divide their father’s estate, — the Court of Law appoints a guardian for them, and they choose a suitable portion for each (orphan)… R. Naḥman on his own stated: When they reach their majority, they cannot protest, for if so, where is the power of the authority of the Court of Law?’ Since in legal matters we adopt the ruling of R. Naḥman, it follows that the Court of Law or the guardian have the right to make a settlement for the benefit of the orphans and this remains in force even when they reach their majority. Moreover, even if the Court of Law had not issued a decree, the orphans cannot protest against the settlement when they reach their majority, because since this was done for their benefit it is tantamount to a legal transaction consumated on behalf of orphans which is binding even when they become of age — Nethiboth.",

Derived from B.M. 42b: ‘A certain administrator of orphans who bought an ox for them committed it to the care of a cowherd. But it had no molars or (front) teeth to eat with and it died. Said R. Rami b. Ḥama : How should Judges decide this case? Shall we say to the administrator, Go and pay; then he will retort, I committed it to the care of the cowherd (and he should have told me that it does not eat). Shall we say to the cowherd, Go and pay; then he will reply, I put it among the other oxen and I threw food before it; it was impossible to know that it was not eating anything. Now, let us see: The cowherd is a paid trustee of the orphans and should have looked into the matter (whether the ox eats or not) ? — If there were a loss to the orphans, it would be so, but here we deal with a case where there is no loss to the orphans, for they found the owner of the ox (i.e., the seller) and the orphans received their money back from him (on grounds that it was a purchase made in error). Then who is the complainant? — The owner of the ox pleads that he (the administrator) should have informed him. But what could he inform him? He certainly knows that it was a purchase made in error! — He (the owner of the ox) was a middleman who buys here and sells there (immediately). Therefore, he (the middle-man) swears that he knew not (of the animal’s condition) and the cowherd pays the lower price of meat.’ This has reference to two-thirds of the usual price and was considered a sort of settlement because the cowherd advanced the plea, ‘I put it among the other oxen etc.’ Thus Rashi. Tosaf., however, state that the verdict was in accord with strict law, for if the cowherd were to inform the middleman about it, the latter would have had to slaugther it and sell it at a cheap price, not being able to wait until the market day. Cf. supra n. 8. and he is not permitted to allow the verdict to pass out of his hand [only] in part without [bringing the proceedings to] a [complete] close.21The Judge has the right to pronounce judgment according to his discretion (שודא דדייני) when the matter cannot be clarified or he may submit the case to arbitration. This means that he may give his opinion even against the will of the litigants — M.E. This applies only if the Judge recognized fraud on the part of the defendant, in which case he submits the matter to arbitration, but when the claimant is suspected of fraud, the Judge should withdraw from the case — Nethiboth. , infra § 15, 3-4.",

    "text_en": "One against whom there is a monetary claim regarding aught of which he [the defendant] is [illegally] the possessor, is forbidden to seek means to evade [the claim] in order that the person concerned [the plaintiff] should consent to make a settlement with him and forgo the balance [of the claim].22Terumath ha-Deshen s. 30 Cf. B.K. 40a-b: ‘It has been stated: If a man borrowed an ox on the supposition that it is a Tam but was later discovered to have already been formally declared a Mu‘ad (then if it repeated to gore) the owner pays one half of the damages and the borrower pays (the other) half of the damages. But why should the borrower not contend against the owner, I borrowed an ox, I did not borrow a lion? — Rab said: We deal here with a case where the borrower knew that the ox was a gorer (although he knew not that the ox was formally declared a Mu‘ad). Let him therefore plead: I borrowed an ox in the state of Tam, but I did not borrow an ox that was formally declared a Mu‘ad? — Because the owner might retort: In any case, even if the ox had been a Tam, you would have to pay half-damages? Now, too, you must go and pay half-damages. Let him (the borrower) still contend against him: Were the ox in the state of Tam, damages would have to be paid out of its body (the indemnity would be collected from a sale of the animal and not from my best possessions. , Ex. XXI, 35) ? — Because the owner might retort: In any case, would you not have to compensate me (the full value of) the ox? Let him (the borrower), however, plead: Had the ox been a Tam, I would have admitted (the act of goring) and be exempt from making payment (because he who confesses an act with which a fine is connected, — in this case the half-damages which may be considered as of a penal nature — is exempt from the fine). And even according to the one who maintains (v. B.K. 15a) that half-damages is a civil liability (and by making a confession he would not be exempt), the borrower might still contend: Were the ox in a state of Tam, I would have caused it to flee to the meadow (and would have thus avoided payment out of its body which is the law in the case of Tam. , Ex. ibid.) ? — We deal here with a case where the Court of Law took steps first and seized the ox. If so, why should the owner pay half-damages? Let him contend: You were the cause of making my ox fall into the hands of one with whom I cannot go to law? — Because the borrower might argue against him: Were I even to have returned it to you, would they not have taken it from you? But let the owner say to the borrower: Were you to have returned it to me, I would have caused it to flee to the meadow? — Because the borrower might retort: In any case, would the damages not have been paid from the best of your possessions (since the ox was designated Mu‘ad while still in the possession of the owner) ? — This would be a valid argument (by the borrower) where the owner possessed property, but what can be said where the owner possessed no property? — Because the borrower can say to the owner: As well as I am obliged to pay you (i.e., to restore the ox), I am obliged to pay him (the plaintiff who is your creditor). This follows from (the dictum of) R. Nathan. For it was taught: R. Nathan stated: How do we know that if a man claims a Maneh (100 Zuzim) from another and the latter (claims a similar amount) from a third, that money is collected from the one (the last) and given to the other (the first) ? From the verse (Num. V, 7) : And give it unto him whom he hath trespassed (translating: And he [the last debtor] gives it unto him [the first] to whom he [the second] is indebted).’ The argument: ‘I would have caused it to flee to the meadow’ is attacked by Tosaf., a.l. s.v. הוה מערקנא ליה because this would certainly be regarded as an illegal act according to R. Akiba (contra R. Ishmael in B.K. 33a) who is of the opinion that both the plaintiff and the defendant become joint owners of the ox and consequently by causing the ox to escape to the meadow the defendant is regarded as a robber. Furthermore the Court of Law has a right to pronounce the ban against the defendant if he evades payment of damages. Therefore, Tosaf. explain that what is really meant by this argument is this: By causing the ox to flee to the meadow the plaintiff would have made a settlement with me for a small amount. Consequently, the borrower by not returning the ox to the owner has caused the latter damages by having to pay the difference between the settlemnt and the full amount of damages. This explanation of Tosaf. contradicts Caro’s present ruling according to which one is forbidden to employ evasive means in order to obtain the consent of the plaintiff to make a settlement and to forgo the difference. W.G. removes this contradiction by explaining that in B.K. the circumstances are entirely different because the borrower has a valid plea against the owner, viz., that the latter can have nothing against him, since he borrowed the ox on the assumption that it was Tam and it was discovered that it was declared Mu‘ad, consequently, he is not responsible for making any payment towards a liability which is in a different category. Hence, he may employ a vague and paltry reply, namely, ‘I would have caused it to flee to the meadow.’ The same vague reply could be given by the owner, but it does not mean that it is permissible to actually do so. In short, it means that under the circumstances one may state that he would have acted thus, but not that it is really permissible to do this (v. Be’er Eliyahu). In the present ruling however, we are told what the final law is in such a case. Tummim advances another interpretation. In B.K. we deal with a case where the owner may be trying to collect an old loan from the plaintiff, but he has no witnesses to prove this. Consequently, under the circumstances he may employ evasive means to recover his debt. Shebuth Ya‘akob differentiates between Tosaf. and our present ruling as follows : In B.K. by causing the animal to escape to the meadow it would be considered merely an indirect act, which is permitted on the principle, ‘sit and do nothing’ (שב ואל תעשה עדיף), i.e., it is better not to act directly in doubtful cases; whereas in the present ruling the prohibition is against a direct act to force one into a settlement through evasive means. , also Sheb. 31a that it is forbidden to use evasive means even in support of the truth. Tummim and Nethiboth write that the present ruling has reference only where the plaintiff has a just claim, but where the defendant has a valid counterclaim which he cannot ascertain before the Court of Law, he may employ evasive means, provided he does not appear as a wicked person in the eyes of the Judges. Gloss: And if he violated [this law] and employed [evasive means], he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven until he restores to him [the plaintiff] what rightfully belongs to him.23RaShBA in Resp. Cf. B.K. 55b-56a: According to R. Joshua one of the acts for which one is exempt before men but is liable before Heaven, is to hire false witnesses to offer testimony. Regarding this the Talmud says: ‘In what case? Shall we say for his own benefit, then he has to pay back the money (he thus obtained illegitimately) and should be liable even by the judgment of men? — It therefore means for the benefit of his friend.’ Hence, ‘for his own benefit’ must mean that he employed evasive methods. Yet, it states ‘he has to pay back the money’ whence it follows that the money is recovered by the judgment of men which contradicts Isserles’ ruling who states that ‘he does not comply with the requirements of heaven’ which implies that he is exempt by the judgment of men. Isserles must therefore be in in accord with Tosaf. ibid., s.v. ממונא according to whom if we were to know that they are false witnesses he would have to pay, but since we are ignorant of this, the Talmud cannot very well state that he is exempt by the judgment of men. So too, Isserles, states that ‘he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven’ because by employing evasive means he has thereby kept the entire matter hidden from people so that we are unaware whether he has anything in his possession illegally or not. Hence, the statement, ‘he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven.’",

    "text_en": "Although the litigants consented [to submit their case] to arbitration before the Court of Law, they can retract so long as a formal agreement was not made with them by means of a Kinyan,24Heb. קנין.  Glos. Thus Tur; Tosaf.; Mord. to San.  This is contra Ra’BIaH and RABaN who hold that if the litigants were silent after hearing the verdict of the arbitrators, Kinyan is not necessary — M.E. This applies even if at the outset the litigants agreed to resort to law contra N who rules that if at first they agreed to be tried in Court then subsequently if they consent to submit to arbitration, it holds good even without Kinyan — M.E. In order for the parties not to retract they must not only accept the arbitration by means of a Kinyan but must also expressly state that So-and-so should act as arbitrators. But if the arbitrators were not specified, they cannot arbitrate the case. However, if the contesting parties appeared before three Judges for trial and subsequently agreed to submit their case to arbitration before them, then Kinyan alone without expressly stating the names of the arbitrators is valid (RaN) — Nethiboth. Accordingly, writes Bigde Yesha, if one states to another, ‘I sell you this according to the appraisal of three persons’ (v. infra § 200, 7), or in the case of selling the Ḥameẓ to a non-Jew before the Festival of Passover (the contract containing the clause that the price of the Ḥameẓ will be fixed according to the appraisal of three competent persons), it would be obligatory to expressly mention the three persons. Yet, in the Talmud and the Codes we find no such requirement and even RaN might not be stating this as a law to be adopted. This matter, therefore, requires further study — P.Tesh. The present ruling that they may retract if no formal agreement was made by means of a Kinyan means that even the plaintiff who consented to submit to a settlement with the defendant and to forgo some of his claims and we might have thought that this comes under the heading of ‘a waiver requires no Kinyan’ (מחילה אינה צריכה קנין), — yet, the following distinction should be borne in mind between ‘a waiver’ where the individual of his own accord foregoes certain claims in which case it is binding even without a Kinyan (v. following par. and infra § 241, 2) and ‘a waiver’ which is the result of a settlement through arbitration made by the Judges where a Kinyan is required so that the plaintiff should subsequently not be able to plead against the Judges’ settlement. Hence, even if the Judges told the plaintiff that the defendant will have to pay him a certain amount of the claim and the plaintiff foregoes the balance, a Kinyan is required because the plaintiff foregoes the balance of his claim not of his own accord. Consequently, this implies (Thus D.M.) that if the plaintiff stated after hearing the settlement, ‘I forego certain claims in accord with the verdict of the arbitrators’ or ‘I forego an oath which should have been imposed upon the defendant,’ a Kinyan is not required — M.E. for [the law is that] arbitration requires a Kinyan,25San. 6a. The arbitrators are relied upon that they effected a Kinyan in the event that the litigants deny this. A settlement reached by the litigants alone (i.e., effected by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant), requires no Kinyan, for then it comes under the heading ‘a waiver requires no Kinyan’ — ShaK, MaHaRaM Lublin. Cf. however, infra § 22, 3 from which we see that where the plaintiff himself suggests a settlement, if there was no Kinyan, he may retract contra ruling of MaHaRaM Lublin — P.Tesh. However, if there was only one arbitrator who effected the settlement and he is contradicted, viz., that no Kinyan was made, he is not relied upon, on the principle that the evidence of one witness is not accepted in the case of counter-evidence — Tummim. Judges who state that the litigants agreed to be tried before them and the litigants deny this, — the law is that if there are no other witnesses to corroborate the statement of the Judges, the latter may not try this case, for although they are relied upon as witnesses, nevertheless, they cannot try this case on the principle that ‘a witness may not act as a Judge’ (אין עד נעשה דיין). However, arbitrators under the same circumstances are relied upon because a witness may act as an arbitrator — A.H. If they submitted the case to settlement by arbitration through ‘striking hands’ (תקיעת כף), although it does not have the same effect as a Kinyan, nevertheless, the parties may be compelled to fulfil their promise because ‘striking hands’ has the same status as an oath. Consequently, if the litigant dies, the heirs cannot be forced to submit to arbitration. However, in the case of Kinyan, the heirs may be forced to fulfil the Kinyan — Nethiboth. If they submit to arbitration before the representatives of the town (טובי העיר), Kinyan is not required and the parties cannot retract — R.A.Eger (on the authority of BaḤ. Actually found infra § 22, 1, Gloss). Even if the litigants originally came to Court with the express purpose of submitting their case for arbitration, Kinyan is required — BaḤ, Tummim contra RaShaL. even if made before three.26e., even if three Judges effected the settlement. Thus San. 6a, Rashi s.v. והלכתא. Derived from the fact that R. Ashi (Gem. ibid.) who does not require Kinyan makes no distinction between two or three arbitrators. And since the adopted law is that arbitration requires a Kinyan, it follows, even if the settlement by arbitration was made by three. However, if a formal agreement was made with them by means of a Kinyan, they cannot retract even if made before one.27San. ibid. in accord with the view of the Sages that one is sufficient. Thus also Asheri and Tur. And even R. Simeon b. Gamaliel who holds that two are sufficient (ibid. 5b) is really of the opinion that one suffices (ibid. 6a). N.Yos. writes that Alfasi also holds that one is sufficient (cf. Hagahoth Derisha) — M.E. And some say that [they cannot retract] only if made [at least] before two.28Thus Caro in B.Yos. a.l. and in Kes. Mish. to Yad, Sanhedrin XXII, 6. The difficulty, however, is why does Maim. not rule in accord with the Sages who hold that one is sufficient (v. supra n. 27) ? This difficulty may be removed if we realize that Maim. mentions two in order to indicate that in strict law their decision would not be binding (v. supra § 3, 1, n. 1), but in a settlement of arbitration even Maim. will hold that one is sufficient in accord with the Sages — Be’er ha-Golah. Gloss: [And this has reference] not only to a formal agreement made by means of a Kinyan, but likewise, if he [the defendant] gave a note of indebtedness [thus] obligating himself [to carry out the settlement],29B.Yos. on the authority of Resp. by RITBA — G. Ket. 101b: ‘It was taught: One who said to another, I owe you a Maneh, is liable according to R. Joḥanan; but Resh Lakish holds: He is exempt. Under what circumstances should this be understood? If (this has reference to a case) where one said to them (those present when he made this admission), You are my witnesses, what is the reason of Resh Lakish who rules that he is exempt? (for this would be contra San. 29b)? If, where he did not say to them, You are my witnesses, then what is the reason of R. Joḥanan who rules that he is liable? — Actually, this (refers to a case) where he did not say to them, You are my witnesses, but here we deal with one who said to his fellow, I owe you a Maneh (and in the presence of witnesses) gave him a note of indebtedness (in which he admits the debt in his handwriting but it is not attested to by his signature nor by that of witnesses — Thus Rashi). R. Joḥanan holds that he is liable because the items enumerated in a bond (delivered in the presence of witnesses) are as binding as if the one who delivered it said, You are my witnesses; but Resh Lakish holds, He is exempt because the items enumerated in a bond are not binding.’ Hence, we see that a bond is as binding as a Kinyan. Cf. also Asheri a.l. Although Caro (infra par. 13) already states this law, — Isserles, however, refers to a note of indebtedness before the settlement of arbitration is made known. So long as the defendant states in the document, ‘I hereby obligate myself to pay the amount which will be determined by the arbitrators,’ then even if there were no witnesses, it is binding even regarding aught that the defendant is not indebted to him. The document may also be written in the form of an admission. Cf. infra § 40 — M.E. The document must contain no conditions, for assuming liability on a condition has no legal effect in the case of a bond of indebtedness. It is, however, permitted to make a condition only when a formal agreement is entered into by means of Kinyan — Tummim, Nethiboth. or [by any] one of the other modes of transference of rights.30RaShBA in Resp. to a query — G. Some say that when he assumes [liability by means of] a Kinyan relative to the arbitration, he must give him acquisition rights in the article so that it should not be a [mere] verbal agreement31Mord. — G. B.B. 3a: ‘How have you interpreted the Mishna (ibid. 2a: ‘If two joint owners consent to make a partition in a courtyard they should build the wall in the middle’) ? With reference to a courtyard in which there is no right of division. Then if it deals with one in which there is no right of division, even if both owners consent what does it matter? They can retract? — R. Assi on the authority of R. Joḥanan stated: Each made a formal agreement with the other by means of a Kinyan. But even if they made such an agreement what does it matter since it is a mere verbal agreement (for this relates only to a verbal promise but not to any tangible object) ? — They made an agreement by Kinyan to take different sides (consequently, something tangible is involved).’ Hence, the same applies to arbitration, i.e., the disputed article should be symbolically transferred from the defendant to the plaintiff by means of a Kinyan, the former stating, ‘I hereby transfer the article to you,’ and the latter stating, ‘I hereby forego in my claim whatever the arbitrators will decide.’ In the case of a monetary claim where the law is that ‘money cannot be used for symbolical delivery’ (B.M. 45b a.e.), the defendant must assume the liability to pay as the arbitrators see fit — M.E. Where the plaintiff states that he will forego a certain amount, it does not have its legal effect, for this is regarded as a Kinyan to the effect that ‘I will give’ (קנין אתן) which has no binding force (v. infra § 203) — Nethiboth. , also infra § 245 beg. and § 73. Cf. infra § 22, nn. 11-12. as will be explained infra § 203 beg.",

For in this case, as soon as the plaintiff renounces his claim he has no further dealings with the defendant in this matter, provided, of course, that the plaintiff or creditor, does not retain a note of indebtedness or the like against the defendant or debtor, which must be returned.

Cf. Beẓ. 19b-20a: ‘R. Simeon b. Lakish asked R. Joḥanan: (What is the law if) one said, Behold I take it upon me to vow a thank-offering that I may therewith discharge my duty of Ḥagigah (or) Behold I take it upon me to be a Nazirite that I should shave with the second tithe money (i.e., that on the day that I cut my hair [Num. VI, 13 ff.] the sacrifice that I must then bring should be purchased with second tithe money)? He answered him: He is under the obligation of a vow, but he cannot fulfil (his duty of Ḥagigah thereby) ; he is a Nazirite, but he cannot shave (according to his stipulation to purchase the sacrifice with second tithe money, but only with unconsecrated funds, for once he stated, ‘ I take upon myself etc.,’ he remains under the obligation because his dedication to the Lord by word of mouth is equal to what delivery is in private transactions — Rashi. Consequently, the subsequent condition has no legal effect to change the vow).’ Hence, in the present ruling too, since he made a formal agreement by means of a Kinyan to accept the settlement of arbitration, he cannot retract from his obligation to carry out the settlement by merely paying the fine. However, if he stated, ‘Should I not fulfil the settlement of arbitration, I will pay the fine,’ the law is that if he desires he pays the fine and does not have to carry out the terms of the settlement — Nethiboth.

Cf. Ned. 3b: ‘How is thou shalt not delay to pay it (Deut. XXIII, 22) with regards to Neziruth, applicable? For as soon as he says, Behold I am a Nazir, he becomes a Nazir; if he eats (grapes), he violates, neither shall he … eat moist grapes or dried (Num. VI, 3) ? — When he says, When I wish I will become a Nazir. But if he says, When I wish, the Biblical injunction, thou shalt not delay is not applicable? — Said Raba, e.g., If he says, I must not leave the world before having been a Nazir, for he becomes a Nazir from that very moment. This is similar to one who says to his wife, Behold here is your bill of divorce (to become effective) one hour prior to my death in which case she is straightway forbidden to eat Terumah. Hence, we say that he may die any moment. Consequently, here too, (regarding a Nazir) he becomes a Nazir at once, because we say, Perhaps he will die now.’ Thus we see that when one undertakes to fufil something without mentioning any specified time, it takes effect immediately. Consequently, the same principle operates in the present ruling. Cf. also Sifra to Lev. XV, 25. Once the arbitrators state their decision before the litigants, they must not make any changes, for their commission is then considered completed. However, as long as they have not stated their decision before them, although they had stated it before the witnesses or others, they may still make changes according to their discretion — Birkath Ya‘akob.",

A protest before witnesses against a forced or unduly influenced action. [he had previously made that the arbitration he was about to submit to was forced upon him against his will, the law is that] he [B] can [subsequently] retract therefrom.37Asheri in Resp. For only in the case of a ‘sale’ do we rule, ‘If they tortured (lit. suspended) him, and he agreed to sell, the sale is valid’ תליוה וזבין זביניה זביני (B.B. 48a), for whenever one agrees to sell something it is done under duress (being in need of money) and consequently, his consent, although given under pressure is valid (ibid. 47b). But this has reference only to a sale where he receives money for his article. However, in the case of a gift it is not valid because the donor receives nothing in return, and consequently, does not agree to give the recipient ownership rights in the gift (B.B. 47b, RaShBaM, s.v. תליוה וזבין). Further, in the case of a sale if he made a declaration of protest (מודעא) before witnesses that the sale was being forced upon him against his will, the sale is not valid, whereas in the case of a gift, it is not valid even if the donor did not make a declaration of protest as long as the witnesses know that he was under pressure, or where he issued his protest even if they knew not of his duress. Again, in the case of a gift his cancellation of the declaration of protest unlike the case of a sale, is not valid (save where we knew not of his duress and he cancelled his previous declaration of protest — B.B. 48a, Tosaf. s.v. אמר; infra § 242, 2). Hence, a settlement of arbitration where the plaintiff has no legal grounds is on the same footing as a gift. Therefore, if we know that the defendant is under pressure, his cancellation of the previous notification or declaration of protest has no legal effect. , Be’er Eliyahu. The present ruling is also applicable where the defendant was forced to take an oath, provided the oath was of such a nature that one could cancel or annul it mentally (although the law is that ‘a mental stipulation is not valid’ דברים שבלב אינם דברים [Kid 49b], in the case of pressure it is effective) and that his verbal statement of the oath should not be contradictory to his mental stipulation (v. Y.D. § 232, 14). The present ruling with regards to the ‘cancellation of a notification’ means that it subsequently became known to us that the cancellation was also made under pressure. , B.Yos. and D.M. infra § 205 end and cf. Y.D. § 228, 18 — M.E.",

    "text_en": "[If] two people are in dispute concerning the building of immovable property and a settlement was made between them without a formal agreement by means of a Kinyan, [then] as soon as [the contending parties] accepted [to carry out the settlement] and one party built a little and the other party [also built] a little according to the decision of the arbitrators, they cannot retract.38RaShBA in Resp. Although Tur (infra § 157 beg.) writes that regarding a courtyard belonging to joint-owners in which there is no right of division (i.e., it is not large enough to assign four cubits thereof to each partner) in which case the division must be made by means of a Kinyan (B.B. 3a. , text cited supra n. 31), the law is that as soon as one of the parties takes possession of his share, the division becomes effective and neither may retract (contra Yad, Shekenim II, 10 cited by Caro infra § 157, 2), in the present ruling even Tur will agree that both contending parties must build (or employ any other mode of acquisition depending on the case in question. , supra par. 7) in order that neither should be able to retract, for Tur’s ruling is applicable only infra where each partner had an equal share, only that before the division was made they each made use of the entire coutryard and now it is only a question of making the division legally binding. It is for this reason that Asheri (source of Tur’s ruling) writes (to B.B. 3a) that even if one of the partners took possession of his share in the absence of his fellow-partner and even if the latter did not say to him, ‘Go take possession and acquire ownership’ (v. B.B. 53a and cf. B.B. 3a, Tosaf. s.v. רב אשי) — he acquires ownership. Examine the expression employed in B.B. ibid.: בגון שהלך זה בתוך שלו והחזיק וזה בתוך שלו והחזיק which is explained by Asheri to mean: (‘the division becomes legally effective if) for instance one walked across his own part and took possession or the other did likewise,’ on the principle that as soon as one party takes possession (in the case of movables), the other assumes liability for what is given in exchange (Mishna Kid. 28a) and the same principle operates in the case of immovable property according to Tosef (Ẓ). Kid. I, 9 cited by Asheri because even if one takes possession it is done for the benefit of both parties (thus TaZ); whereas in the present ruling the parties are in dispute as to who should build one part and who the other part. Consequently, both are required to carry out the settlement of the arbitrators in order to make it legally effective. This is contra ‘Ir Shushan who maintains that even in the present case it suffices even if only one party builds — M.E. Hence, according to the present ruling, even if there was no formal agreement by means of a Kinyan, nevertheless, since both parties carry out the terms of the settlement, it is regarded as though a settlement was entered into — A.H.",

    "text_en": "[In the case of] a settlement of arbitration without [entering into] a formal agreement by means of a Kinyan, and they [the contending parties] delivered a pledge into the hand of the arbitrators, — [the law is that] it has no legal consequences45RaShBA in Resp. For this is regarded as an Asmakta (אסמכתא), i.e., a promise to pay or to forfeit pledged property (or equivalent) without having received a sufficient consideration; collateral security with the condition of forfeiture beyond the amount to be received, e.g., A pays a portion of his indebtedness to B, leaving the note of indebtedness as a security in the hands of a third party, and agreeing to pay the full amount on the note, if, at the stipulated time, he should fail to pay the due balance. , B.B. 168a. unless they said, [This pledge] is no mere Asmakta'46 however, infra § 61, 5, Gloss; § 207, 18 according to which even if one stated, ‘This is no mere Asmakta’ it still has no legal validity. Consequently, the present ruling is difficult and requires further elucidation — ShaK. However, according to B.B. 44b, even if one inserts in the note the words, ‘this note is no mere Asmakta or draft form’ it has no legal force unless movables were mortgaged along with immovables and only then does the creditor acquire a lien over the immovables and one over the movables also, for then it is similar to Asmakta but is not a real Asmakta. But in the case of movables alone the insertion of the above declaration is of no avail. It is therefore, possible that arbitration is not a real Asmakta but is similar to one. Hence, the words, ‘this pledge is no mere Asmakta’ must be stated. For were arbitration a real Asmakta even Kinyan would have no legal force. Nevertheless, this matter requires further study. , Be’er Eliyahu to W.G. or ['Let it be yours] from now.'47B.M. 66b: (Ref. to Mishna ibid. 65b: ‘If one lent money on a field and said to him, If you do not pay me within three years, it should be mine, it becomes his’) ‘If you prefer, I may say that it means that he said to him (the debtor), Let it be yours from now’ (under these conditions it is no longer an Asmakta since the money was given as the purchase price and acquires for him ownership rights. It is not regarded as a loan save that the vendor has the privilege of repurchase). We see, therefore, that when one states, ‘Let it be yours from now,’ although there is still a condition that has to be fulfilled, nevertheless, it is no longer viewed as an Asmakta. So too, in the case of arbitration when one says he gives the other ownership rights in the pledge ‘from now,’ it becomes the possession of the latter forthwith as a gift made with the condition that it must be returned which is legally a valid gift, i.e., it becomes the recipient’s property for the time being (v. Kid. 6b a.e.). Thus Be’er Eliyahu to W.G. Hence, under these conditions it is not considered an Asmakta. , infra § 207, 9, 14 and cf. Asheri to B.M. ibid. on different types of Asmakta. And if the pledge was a note of indebtedness, [mere delivery thereof] has no legal consequences.48RaShBA in Resp. Derived from B.B. 77a in accord with Amemar (following the version of Alfasi; Yad, Mekirah VI, 10-11; Tosaf. s.v. אמר and Asheri) that a note of indebtedness is acquired by both delivery (מסירה) and by writing a bill of sale (כתיבה). Cf. infra § 66, 1 and B.Yos. a.l. Mere delivery of the note gives one rights only to the scrap of paper but does not confer any right to the debt.",

Nowadays it is the accepted custom that even in a case of strict law the two litigants may choose the third Judge — A.H. 'Let So-and-so act as Judge for me,' — then these two Judges each of whom were chosen respectively by the litigants nominate a third Judge;2Thus Yad, Sanhedrin VII, 1 according to reading of SeMaG (v. also Kesef Mishneh ibid.; B.Yos. a.l.). Derived from San. 23a in accord with the Sages. If the two chosen Judges are related to each other, the defendant has the advantage to compel the plaintiff to select another Judge (Isserles in Resp.) — R.A.Eger. and it is not necessary that the third Judge [should be nominated] with the consent of the litigants;3Thus Tur. Derived from San. ibid.: ‘No one disagrees that the (third) Judge must have the consent of his colleagues; they (R. Meir and the Sages) merely differ whether the consent of the litigants is (also) required. R. Meir holds that the consent of the litigants is also necessary; whereas the Sages maintain: only that of the Judges is necessary but not that of the litigants.’ The law follows the opinion of the Sages. Should the defendant agree that the selection of the third Judge should also be made with the consent of the litigants, it is permissible (v. Bertinoro San. ibid., and cf. comments of Tosaf. Yom Tob) — P.Tesh. And even according to Lebush that such a procedure will delay the execution of justice (עינוי הדין) for the defendant may always disagree with the plaintiff’s choice, — yet, if the plaintiff agrees that the third Judge be chosen with the consent of the contending parties, Lebush will also agree that it is permissible — P.Tesh. and all three of them [the Judges] try them [the litigants],4Yad ibid. in accord with San. ibid. that the meaning of the words, ‘Each party chooses one’ refers not to a Court of Law but to one Judge. Hence, each party chooses one Judge and they jointly nominate a third. for in this wise a true judgment will be rendered.5San. ibid.: ‘Since each litigant chooses a Judge and jointly they nominate a third, a true judgment will be rendered.’ Even if the one [Judge] whom the litigant chose was a distinguished and ordained scholar, he cannot compel his fellow-litigant that he [the latter] be tried by this [distinguished Judge], but he [the fellow-litigant] too, may choose whomever he desires [to act as Judge on his behalf].6Whether superior or inferior to the other in learning — M.E. The Judge must, however, be versed in law or must be a recognized Mumḥeh. Otherwise, he may be rejected (B.Yos. citing R. Yeruḥam) — ShaK. This ruling is derived from San. ibid.: ‘R. Papa stated: It has reference even to Mumḥin (i.e., the debtor or defendant may reject the Judge chosen by the creditor or plaintiff even if he is a Mumḥeh), e.g., the Courts of R. Huna and R. Ḥisda (their Courts were close to each other), for he (the defendant) can say: Am I troubling you?’ This applies where one litigant persuaded the Mumḥeh to act in the capacity of an ‘arbiter’ (בורר), but if he said to his fellow-litigant, ‘Come, let us have our case tried before the city Sage, the latter is not designated an ‘arbiter’ and is the Judge for both parties — M.E. Although the law is that an individual Mumḥeh may judge alone against the will of the defendant, it applies only where the latter refuses to appear for trial, but where he states, ‘I wish to select another Judge too, he is obeyed — BaḤ, ShaK contra M.E. Gloss: For since each party chooses a Judge, the litigants obey them, and the Judges, too, will each examine [points] in favour of the one who chose him whereever it is possible [to do so] from the legal point of view,7Thus Rashi San. ibid. s.v. יצא and Asheri. Cf. also Y. San. III, 1(21a): ‘Because he has chosen him as arbiter, he will advocate his (client’s) claim.’ Since they both feel that their rights are equally secure. and the third [Judge] hears the [legal] arguments of both of them [and compromises between them] and [thus together] they render a true verdict.8Tur — G. All the laws of Judges apply equally in the case of arbiters — P.Tesh. If they [the two Judges] cannot reach an agreement in nominating the third Judge, [then] the town leaders appoint for them a third [Judge]. And if there are no leaders in the town, [then] the plaintiff may go before three [Judges] and they compel the defendant to be tried before them.9Asheri to San. ibid. For just as in the case of a Court of three or one authoritative Judge, the law is that they may try cases even against the will of the defendant where he refuses to appear before the Court (cf. San. 5a, Tosaf. s.v. דן), so too, the leaders or the representatives of the town enjoy the same status (v. supra § 2 and notes). And likewise if the defendant deliberately selects a Judge who is unworthy in order that he sit in judgment with a worthy Judge, they may compel him to be tried before three Judges as has been explained supra § 3, [par. 4], or that he select a worthy Judge.10Tur — G. San. ibid.: ‘The pureminded of Jerusalem used to act thus … they would not sit in judgment unless they knew who was to sit with them.’ But if the plaintiff deliberately chooses an unworthy Judge, the defendant may say to him, ‘I will not answer your pleas until you choose a worthy Judge’ — M.E. However, if the two arbiters can reach an harmonious decision [in the case], some say that they are not required to nominate a third [Judge].11MaHaRIW s. 11 — G. Since the parties accepted them, it is sufficient. And where the contesting parties agreed to be tried by them, the law is that even an unauthoritative Judge may try the case (v. San. 5a, Tosaf. s.v. דן). Cf. also San. 6a. Hence, it follows that even in the first instance where the Judge was accepted, his judgment is valid, and much more so where two Judges were accepted, each by one of the parties. Consequently, we assume that the intention of the litigants is that if the two selected Judges reach a harmonious decision, there is no need for them to choose a third Judge. TaZ (followed by A.H.) disagrees with this ruling. Some say that if the defendant states that he will select two [Judges] and [that] the plaintiff should likewise select two [Judges], and they [the selected Judges] will nominate a fifth [Judge], — he is permitted to do so, for as long as there is a greater number of Judges, a true judgment will be rendered.12N. to Deut. I, 12 — G. Cf. Y. San. III, 3(21a).",

And so long as they did not write [this document], they [the contesting parties] may retract, but once they prepared [this document], they cannot retract.13Thus Tur. Derived from Mishna B.M. 20a: ‘If one found documents of Berurin,’ which is explained in Gemara ibid.: ‘What is meant by documents of Berurin? — Here (in Babylon) they explain it as records of pleas (minutes of Court proceedings). R. Jeremiah stated: (Documents referring to the choice of arbiters, stating): This party selected one (Judge) and that party selected another (Judge).’ , also B.B. 168a. The present ruling follows the interpretation given by R. Jeremiah. Cf. also Y.M.K. III, 3(82a) bot. The choice of the Judges was recorded by the contesting parties so that they should not be able to retract. Thus Rashi, Asheri and other Codifiers. Therefore, they do not write [this document] save with the consent of both parties,14e., since they cannot retract after the document is prepared, therefore … For the principle is that ‘one may not act to another’s disadvantage in his absence’ אין חבין לאדם שלא בפניו· Hence, their approval is necessary — Perisha, M.E. and both pay the scribe's fee.15Mishna B.B. 167b: ‘Documents referring to the choice of arbiters … are not written execept with the consent of both parties and both pay the fee (for the preparation of the documents).’ Gloss: And likewise if they made [each party] obligate himself by means of a Kinyan.16N.Yos. to B.M. I — G. San. 24b: ‘After one enters into an agreement by means of a Kinyan, nothing (can be done to cancel the agreement).’ For it is then regarded as the conclusion of the trial. Cf. Y. San. III, 3(21a): ‘Once the trial is concluded no one may retract.’ Some say that once they stated their pleas before them [the Judges], they cannot retract even if they did not prepare a document.17N.Yos. on the authority of Y. — G. Y. San. III, 4(21a): ‘If one accepted to be tried before two, he may retract; before three, he may not retract.’ This is explained by N.Yos. and Asheri to B.M. ibid. to mean that the parties had already stated their pleas before the Judges. Hence, if before three, they cannot retract. And it seems to me that in a locality where it is not the practice to prepare a document [in which it is stated], 'So-and-so chose So-and-so etc., [then] once they [the contesting parties] stated their pleas before them [the Judges], all agree that neither of them can retract.18 infra § 80, 2, Gloss. And where one cannot retract, one likewise cannot state that the number of Judges should be increased.19Once the pleas have been stated the trial is considered as concluded and the litigants have no right to request that the Judges be increased so that a new trial take place. Thus according to Y. ibid. , W.G. and Be’er Eliyahu a.l. However, if all the Judges agree to increase the number of the Judges, they may do so even without the approval of the contesting parties (Beth Ya‘akob) — P.Tesh. Tummim writes that the fact that the litigants have no right to increase the number of the Judges has reference only to a case of arbiters (בוררים), but where they are tried by the appointed Court of Law in the town, they may demand that the number of Judges be increased, even after the litigants have presented their pleas before the Judges. Cf. infra § 18.",

Not only must we not compel one litigant to submit his arguments in writing to his fellow-litigant because he may state: ‘You (i.e., the fellow-litigant) appear to me like a lurking lion’ (B.B. 168a), i.e., ‘I have no confidence in you,’ for you merely wish to acquaint yourself with my arguments in order to prepare or have someone else prepare counter-arguments against me; but even the Court of Law cannot force any litigant to submit to them the pleas in writing even if he had already stated his pleas before them, because once the arguments are recorded, the litigant can no longer alter them (N.Yos. to Mishna B.B. 167b. Cf. supra n. 15) — M.E. nor may a Judge receive [the arguments of the litigants] in writing,21e., where the litigants have not yet stated their arguments orally. Thus RIBaSh cited by B.Yos. For then one litigant will have to go to the trouble and expense of obtaining a copy of the other litigant’s arguments in order to present his counter-arguments in writing. Furthermore, the law is that the Judges must hear the arguments orally, for then it is more feasible for them to detect any false statements in the pleas which would not be the case were the litigants permitted to present their cases in prepared written documents, phrased very carefully (and in some instances written by another party) in order to influence the Court on their behalf — M.E. but they [the members of the Court of Law] should hear the arguments orally and they22e., the Judges instruct the scribes to record the arguments after they were heard orally — M.E. instruct the scribe to set them [the arguments] down in writing and they should not write save with the approval of both parties and both pay the scribe's fee.23So as not to be able to retract subsequently. , supra nn. 14 and 15.

III, 1(23a): ‘Each party may disqualify the Judge chosen by the other. So R. Meir. But the Sages say: When does this apply? Only if they can bring proof that they are kinsmen or (otherwise) ineligible; but if they are eligible or recognized by the Court of Law as Mumḥin, they cannot be disqualified. Each may disqualify the other’s witnesses. So R. Meir. But the Sages say: When does this apply? Only if they can bring proof that they are kinsmen or (otherwise) ineligible; but if they are eligible they cannot be disqualified.’ Gemara ibid. 23b: ‘R. Eleazar stated: This (i.e., the part of the Mishna which deals with disqualifying the witnesses) applies where he (the litigant) together with another person came to disqualify them (Alone he would not have the authority to declare the witnesses ineligible). But does he have the authority to do this, the fact being that he is an interested party (consequently only one witness is left and the law is that one witness does not have the authority to disqualify the testimony of two)? — R. Aḥa b. R. Ika said: (Yes;) e.g., where the qualification of one of the witnesses was contested. Of what nature was that alleged disqualification? Shall we say a disqualification based on a charge of robbery? But does he have the authority to do this, the fact being that he is an interested party? Hence, the disqualification must be based on alleged family blemish (descent from slaves whose testimony is inadmissible or in the case of a Judge who is descended from converts. Cf. supra § 7 beg.). R. Meir maintains that they (the litigant and the one who substantiates his testimony) testify against the man’s family blemish, while he (his fellow-litigant) automatically becomes disqualified; and the Sages contend that after all said and done he is still an interested party.’ The law follows the opinion of the Sages. Although the above discussion refers only to that part of the Mishna that deals with the disqualification of witnesses, the same principle applies to Judges adopted in the present ruling.",

Otherwise the law is that in a settlement of arbitration we do not follow the majority (v. supra § 12, 18, n. 44). However, in a case where they resort to law we follow the majority unless one of the Judges was undecided (v. infra § 18, 1) — M.E. According to R.A.Eger since resorting to law or submitting to arbitration were mentioned together, then even if this provision was not set down in writing, we follow the majority even in a settlement of arbitration. and one of them [the chosen persons] withdrew [from the case] and does not state his opinion32Mishna San. 29a: ‘If two (Judges) said, He is not guilty, and one said, He is guilty, he is not guilty; if two said, He is guilty, and one said, He is not guilty, he is guilty; if one said, He is guilty and one said, He is not guilty, or two declared him not guilty or two declared him guilty, while one said, I do not know, the number of Judges is increased.’ Gemara ibid. 30a: ‘How is (the verdict phrased (in a case where the Judges disagree)? — R. Joḥanan said: (The defendant) is not guilty. Resh Lakish said: So-and-so (of the Judges) declare him not guilty; So-and-so declare him guilty. R. Eleazar said: The defendant has been acquitted by their (the Court’s) verdict. Wherein do they differ? … They differ as to whether they must pay his share (in case of an erroneous decision. Cf. ibid. 6a, 33a) in addition to their own. According to the view (that the verdict is worded): He is not guilty, they are held responsible for payment (in full because their opinion was adopted); but according to the opinion (that the wording is): So-and-so (of the Judges) declare him not guilty and So-and-so declare him guilty, they are not obliged to pay (the share of the dissenting Judge. Their opinions are specified separately to indicate that the final verdict was given only by two — Rashi). But even according to the view (that the verdict should be worded): He (the defendant) is not guilty, why should they be held responsible for payment (in full)? Let them say to him (the third Judge): Had you not sat in judgment with us, the verdict would not have been passed at all!’ Hence, we see that if the dissenting Judge would have dismissed himself from sitting in judgment after noticing that the other Judges have erred, or had he stated, ‘I do not know,’ then the entire trial would have no result at all. Therefore, by stating his view he was the cause of the other Judges reaching a decision in the case and should be held responsible for his share of compensation. The same principle operates even where the number of the Judges would be more than three. or that he states, 'I know not [how to decide the case],'33And is then regarded as non-existent, i.e., as if he withdrew from the case. , San. 17a, 5b.

For it might have been possible that were the Judge who stated, ‘I do not know how to decide’ to advance a dissenting opinion, the others would have concurred with him. Should however, the one who withdrew from the case appear subsequently and state that he agrees with the view of the other Judges, the decision is considered valid — P.Tesh.

Derived from San. 31b: ‘R. Safra said on the authority of R. Joḥanan: If two litigants are in obdurate dissension regarding (the venue of) a lawsuit, one saying, Let us go to law here, and the other saying, Let us go to the place of Assembly, they compel him (the one who demands to go to the place of Assembly) and he attends the Court in his home town.’ According to Maim. (Yad ibid.) followed here by Caro no distinction is made between the Supreme Court of Law (Beth Din ha-Gadol) and the place of Assembly (Beth ha-Wa‘ad, a meeting place for scholars). Tosaf. (B.K. 112b, s.v. מצי); Asheri; Tur and RaShaL state that this ruling has reference only to the place of Assembly, viz., that only when the plaintiff demands of the defendant to go to the place of Assembly, the latter must submit but not if the defendant demands it (even if he offers to defray the travelling expenses. Thus N). However, if the defendant demands to have the case tried by the Supreme Court of Law, and needless to say if the plaintiff makes this demand, he is obeyed. Cf. also Isserles anon — M.E., ShaK. Cf. supra § 3, 1, n. 11 and B.K. 112b. And if he stated, 'Write down the reasons for your verdict and give [them] to me, for you may have erred,' — they write [them] down and give [them] to him4Yad ibid. Derived from San. ibid.: ‘If he (the litigant who was compelled to attend Court in the plaintiff’s home town) stated: Write down the reasons for your decision and give them to me (in order to establish the legality of the verdict), they write them down and give him the document.’ Only the arguments of the litigants and the verdict are recorded. For only when the litigant doubts the impartiality of the Judge, the latter must inform him the grounds of his verdict (B.M. 69a-b). , infra par. 4, Gloss. The Court must state in the written verdict that they give permission to examine the verdict. Otherwise, it is forbidden to judge a case where the verdict had already been given by others because of the principle that ‘one Court of Law is not careful in its examination of a case already tried by another Court of Law’ (בי דינא בתר בי דינא לא דייקא), v., Yeb. 106a; B.B. 138b: ‘We are not afraid of (i.e., we do not provide against) an erring Court of Law.’ Needless to say that a written verdict is given only by a smaller Court. The reason why Isserles does not explain this here (viz., that only the arguments and the verdict are recorded) is simply because here we deal with a case where one was compelled to attend the local Court. Hence, it is understood that the defendant has a right to ask for this document — M.E. However, where the defendant was not compelled to be tried, but appeared willingly, then even a smaller Court is not required to give the verdict to the litigant in writing even for the purpose of referring the case to the Supreme Court of Law — A.H. and afterwards they exact payment from him [in accordance with their verdict].5Payment must be made forthwith, and if he subsequently produces written evidence from the Supreme Court wherein it is stated that the local Court erred, they must return his money. , infra par. 4, Gloss and D.M. a.l. — M.E. Cf. B.B. 41b: ‘R. Kahana retorted: I can bring you a letter from the West (i.e., the Land of Israel, from the Supreme Court) that the Halachah does not rest with R. Simeon b. Eleazar. Said R. Judah to him: (My verdict stands) until you produce it.’ Thus we see that the verdict is enforced immediately. If A and B appeared for trial and the Judge required B to take an oath in order to disprove A’s claim, whereupon B demands that the Judge give him a document stating the grounds on which he is required to take an oath, the law is that B is legally justified in his demand. Hence, they give him the document and exact payment from him forthwith. Needless to say that we deal here with a case where the defendant was compelled to appear in the local Court — P.Tesh. If it was necessary to consult the Supreme Court of Law, they set down [their inquiry] in writing and send it on and seek advice [from them],6, supra § 13, n. 28. This means that even if the members of the local Court are unversed in the laws of adjudication and they must consult the Supreme Court, nevertheless, the defendant cannot argue that since they are unversed in the laws and in order to avoid unnecessary expenses in sending messengers to the Supreme Court, the litigants should go directly to the Supreme Court — M.E. and they [the inquiring Court of Law] try them [the litigants] in their own town according to the [ruling contained] in the document of the Supreme Court of Law,7, supra § 13, 6, n. 15. and both litigants pay the messenger's fee.8Cf. Mishna B.B. 167b. The reason being that both parties are vitally interested in having the matter clairified. Consequently, they must share the costs. , Be’er Eliyahu. Gloss: However, if one of the litigants or the Judges desires to send [the inquiry] to a distant country while there is a scholar close by them who is worthy to try the case, — [then] they send [the inquiry] to the one close by, although the one who is at a distance is a greater scholar, for he [the litigant] has no authority to be the cause of a loss to his [fellow-] litigant, [viz.,] to increase the fee for the message [dispatched], and so much the more if there is another scholar in their town who is worthy to adjudicate [the case].9Mord. to San. III end — G. Derived from San. 23a in accord with R. Papa’s interpretation (v. text supra § 13, n. 6) according to which the debtor must not put the creditor to additional trouble (and similarly additional expenses. , Be’er Eliyahu a.l.) and likewise in the case of two litigants where there is a local authority available. Cf. also Y. San. III, 2(21a): ‘R. Eleazar stated: If one (litigant) demands to attend Court in Tiberias and the other (litigant) demands to be tried in Sepphoris (where there was a more renowned Court), we comply with the request of the one (who wishes to be tried) in Tiberias … R. La said … this (has reference only to a case) where they dwell in the same city (according to others ‘the same distance’ from both cities), i.e., from here (the locality of the litigant) to here (Tiberias) there are nine Mils and from here (the locality of the other litigant) to here (Sepphoris) there are (also) nine (Thus version of N.Yos.) Mils.’ Hence, if Tiberias would be farther away than Sepphoris the litigant cannot be compelled to be tried in Tiberias despite the fact that it possesses a more renowned Court of Law. If two Scholars are close by at an equal [distance], we accept as authority the greater one.10N.Yos. to San. III beg. — G. Derived from Y. San. ibid. , previous note. When does this apply?11That neither litigant may be compelled to attend the Supreme Court of Law. — In connection with other laws, [viz.,] where one [litigant] is a claimant and the other [litigant] is [also] a claimant, or where the creditor says,12Thus M.E. Cur. edd. have ‘said.’ 'Let us attend Court here,' and the debtor says, 'Let us go to the Supreme Court of Law;'13But if the creditor is going there in any case he may be compelled to be tried by the Supreme Court — M.E. and Nethiboth contra ShaK who on the authority of BaḤ rejects this and rules that the creditor may compel the debtor to be tried by the local Court even if the creditor has to be in the vicinity of the Supreme Court in any case. The present ruling is derived from San. 31b: ‘When R. Dimi arrived (from the Land of Israel), he stated on the authority of R. Joḥanan: One who forces his fellow to stand with him for trial (Thus Yad Ramah), and one of them (the more powerful one) says, Let us attend Court here, while the other says, Let us go to the place of Assembly (v. supra n. 3), he is compelled to go to the place of Assembly. R. Eleazar said in his presence, Rabbi! One who has a claim against his neighbour in the amount of a Maneh, must he expend another Maneh in addition to the (first) Maneh (in travelling expenses)? (Certainly not), but he is compelled to be tried (by the local Court) in his (the creditor’s home town.’ Ibid.: ‘Amemar said: The law is that he (the plaintiff) is compelled to go to the place of Assembly. Said R. Ashi to him: Did not R. Eleazar say, He (the defendant) must attend Court in his (the plaintiff’s) home town? — This applies only where the debtor demands of the creditor (to be tried at the place of Assembly); but if the creditor (demands this, the debtor must yield, because) ‘The borrower is servant to the lender (Prov. XXII, 7).’ We thus see that only where the reason ‘the borrower is servant to the lender’ applies that we compel the debtor to go to the place of Assembly if such is the creditor’s wish; but where this reason is not applicable, e.g., where both litigants are claimants, they are tried in the local Court. This follows Maim. and Caro’s interpretation of place of Assembly (v. supra n. 3). but if the creditor said, 'Let us go to the Supreme Court of Law,' — they compel the debtor and he goes up with him [the creditor].14For only in the case where both are claimants we do not obey the wish of the one who demands to be tried before the Supreme Court (cf. the expression שנים שנתעצמו in San. ibid.). And this applies both to a claim regarding a loan, robbery or damages, since they are both claimants concerning aught which is not in the possession of either of them. In short, it is not firmly established that one of them is a defendant (נתבע), but both are claimants (זה טוען וזה טוען), in which case we do not yield to the demands made by the one who says, ‘Let us be tried by the Supreme Court.’ However, where the litigants fall into the category of a claimant (תובע) and a defendant (נתבע), then we submit to the demand of the claimant — TaZ. Cf. M.E. Likewise, if one party claimed that one injured or robbed him and the claimant wishes to go up [and have the case tried by the Supreme Court of Law], [then] the Court of Law that is in his town compels the defendant to go up with him, and so too, in all analogous cases.15Yad, Sanhedrin VI, 7. For in these cases too, the defendant is a servant of the claimant until he pays for the damages or establishes that he was not the cause of the damages. Cf. San. 31b regarding the message that was sent to Mar ‘Ukba in Babylon by the Court of Israel with respect to ‘Ukban, the Babylonian, who complained that his brother Jeremiah wronged him, and instructions were given to ‘Ukban to try him in Babylon, and should the latter not accept the verdict, to see to it that he appears before the Court in Tiberias. Thus we see that not only in the case of a creditor and debtor may we compel the defendant to be tried in the Land of Israel before the Supreme Court, but also in all other cases of injury. Thus also Ket. 16b, Tosaf. s.v. כותבין; Asheri to San. ibid. Cf. Ket. 41b; B.K. 15b. N.Yos., however, holds that the principle ‘the borrower is servant etc.,’ applies only to loans but not to other types of injury. [Furthermore,] when does this apply?16That the defendant may be compelled to attend the Supreme Court of Law. — When the one robbed or the one who was injured or the creditor produce witnesses or proof [to substantiate their claim],17So that not everyone should make a claim against his fellow and demand to be tried before the Supreme Court of Law in order that the defendant who will have to lose time and money by going there be forced to make a settlement with the claimant. but [where the claimant puts forth] an unfounded claim, we do not require the defendant to leave at all save that he takes an oath and is free [from payment].18Since the principle the borrower is servant to the lender does not apply because we have no proof that he is a borrower. So too, is the law nowadays when no Supreme Court of Law exists there.19Yad, Sanhedrin VI, 9. Derived from San. 32b: ‘Our Rabbis taught: Justice, justice shalt thou follow (Deut. XVI, 20) means, Follow a renowned Court of Law, e.g., (follow) R. Eliezer (b. Hyrkanus) to Lydda, R. Joḥanan b. Zakkai to Beror Hail.’ Some say that an eminent Court of Law in every generation according to whatever standing it may have, is regarded as the Supreme Court of Law.20Tur — G. Isserles informs us here that even according to Maim. who makes no distinction between the Supreme Court of Law and the place of Assembly (v. supra n. 3) refers in his ruling to localities in the same province, because nowadays we have no power to compel one to leave one province and be tried in another province as was the case when the Supreme Court was in existence. This follows from the fact that Maim. does not employ the term מדינות (provinces) but rather מקומות (localities). Hence, Isserles adduces a dissenting opinion (Asheri, Tur) that even nowadays a renowned Court of Law (בית דין חשוב) has the same authority as the ancient Supreme Court. Consequently, one may be compelled to be tried in another province — TaZ. However, if there are localities in that province20Tur — G. Isserles informs us here that even according to Maim. who makes no distinction between the Supreme Court of Law and the place of Assembly (v. supra n. 3) refers in his ruling to localities in the same province, because nowadays we have no power to compel one to leave one province and be tried in another province as was the case when the Supreme Court was in existence. This follows from the fact that Maim. does not employ the term מדינות (provinces) but rather מקומות (localities). Hence, Isserles adduces a dissenting opinion (Asheri, Tur) that even nowadays a renowned Court of Law (בית דין חשוב) has the same authority as the ancient Supreme Court. Consequently, one may be compelled to be tried in another province — TaZ. wherein there are distinguished Scholars recognized as authorities by the public, and [there are also] localities wherein there are disciples who are not [as distinguished] as they, — [then] if the creditor stated, 'Let us go to a certain locality in a certain country to So-and-so, the distinguished personage, and attend Court before him, — [the law is that] we may compel the debtor [to submit to the creditor's demand] and he goes with him. Gloss: [Provided] if the claimant produces witnesses or proof [to substantiate his claim]21This is in accord with Maim. interpretation (v. Caro supra) that just as in the times of the Supreme Court of Law if the claimant had witnesses or other substantial evidence in which case he could compel the defendant to go with him to the Supreme Court of Law, so too, nowadays any authoritative Court of Law falls into the same category. Hence, the claimant may compel the defendant to be tried there — M.E. or22Thus M.E. , supra § 8, n. 2. it appears to the Court in his home town that there is substance in his claims, but otherwise he [the defendant] is not compelled to go with him.23Tur — G. And some say that [with respect to] claims put forth [by contesting parties], [viz.,] 'Let us attend the Supreme Court of Law,' there is no difference between a claimant and a defendant, and [the law is that] each one [of the litigants] can compel his fellow [-litigant] to go with him.24Tur on the authority of R. Tam. — G. , supra n. 3. All this is [applicable] from the legal point of view, but nowadays it is already the adopted custom that as long as there is a Court of Law in town, one [litigant] cannot compel his fellow [-litigant] to go with him to another Court of Law,25MaHaRIK Rt. 21 — G. Those who have burial plots reserved in that city are treated as coming under the jurisdiction of the local Court of Law (Isserlein) — M.E. for now we have no Supreme Court of Law or House of Assembly.26For the litigant who demands that he be tried before another Court of Law might be an impostor and deliberately wishes to postpone the case. Cf. B.K. 113a and supra § 5, n. 14. Therefore, [the defendant] cannot put him off; but he [the defendant] can put him off, [i.e.,] not to attend Court with him [the claimant] until the third day.27This applies only if he advances a plausible explanation for the postponement and has reference to people who live in country towns and depart from and return to the city, but not to those who live in the same city — M.E. , supra § 11, 1 and notes. However, they choose the Judges forthwith.28Judges are chosen forthwith so as not to delay the matter on the third day — M.E. But a [transient] lodger who makes a claim against the townspeople, or two [transient] lodgers [who sue each other, — the law is that] one must attend Court with him forthwith and one cannot put him off.29Mord. on the authority of R. Samson of Sens — G. , supra n. 26. , however, N to Deut. XIV, 18 who states that if the two litigants are from another city, they can each demand to be tried before the Court of Law in their own city which contradicts the present ruling. It seems therefore, that in the present ruling we deal with a case of two guests (transient lodgers) from two different cities. Hence, if we do not compel them to be tried here, it will be difficult for the plaintiff to find the defendant later; while N deals with two litigants who are both from the same city where this problem does not arise — P.Tesh. Likewise, a townsman who makes a claim against a [transient] lodger, — [the law is that] wherever he finds him and there is a Court of Law there, he [the townsman] may force him [the lodger] to attend Court in that place.30MaHaRIK Rt. 14 — G. All this is [applicable] when there is a Court of Law [available] in their home town, but if there is no Court of Law [available] there, each one [of the litigants] can force his fellow [-litigant] to go with him to a Court of Law to be tried with him.31Mord. to San. III end and Decisions of Isserlein s. 65 — G. The claimant must go after the defendant if the latter is in another city, although in the claimant's home town the Court of Law is more eminent,32MaHaRIK Rt. 1 — G. Derived from B.K. 46b: ‘R. Samuel b. Naḥmani said: Whence do we derive that on him (the claimant) that would exact aught from his fellow lies the burden of proof (onus probandi)? For it is said: If any man have any matter to do, let him come unto them (Ex. XXIV, 14), (which implies): Let him bring proof before them. But R. Ashi objected: Do we require a Scriptural verse to inform us this? Is this not founded on reason that he who feels sick goes to the physician?’ Likewise, in the present ruling the claimant who ‘has pains’ must go to the city of the defendant. and even [if] the defendant had money in [the form of a] bailment in the claimant's home town or in another town, unless he [the claimant] can retain33By means of a saisie-arret. This, of course, means that the claimant must be able to show that he has a right to seize the money, e.g., where he will not be able to take the defendant to law later or where there are other logical reasons for going through with the seizure (v. infra § 73, 10). If after the money was seized the defendant demands his money, he must then go to law with the claimant in the local Court where the money was seized — M.E. his [the defendant's] money in his home town, [and if so,] it is then necessary to inform the defendant thereof34And the expense for sending the message to the defendant must be defrayed by the claimant — M.E. and consequently, he [the defendant] must attend Court in the locality wherein his money [is found].35Terumath ha-Deshen s. 305 and in Decisions of same s. 62 — G. MaHaRIK writes that the custom has spread to seize the defendant’s money wherever it may be. Accordingly, it seems that the claimant may sue the defendant wherever he seized the money. Cf., however, Isserles infra § 73, 10 whence this inference does not follow — M.E. Although the defendant now becomes a claimant, nevertheless, he cannot appoint a mandatory (מורשה) to act on his behalf — P.Tesh. , infra § 73 [wherein] I wrote when [it is possible that] he [the claimant] can retain33By means of a saisie-arret. This, of course, means that the claimant must be able to show that he has a right to seize the money, e.g., where he will not be able to take the defendant to law later or where there are other logical reasons for going through with the seizure (v. infra § 73, 10). If after the money was seized the defendant demands his money, he must then go to law with the claimant in the local Court where the money was seized — M.E. his [the defendant's] money. A father [or mother]36Thus A.H. who has a claim against his [or her] son, [the law is that] the son, although he is the defendant, must go after his father [or mother] as has been explained.37Y.D. § 240, 8 — G. This applies even if the father has a claim against another person in the same locality where his son lives. The travelling expenses, however, must be paid by the father (Y.D. ibid.). Cf. Kid. 31a and Tosaf. s.v. וטורדו. The same ruling applies to a distinguised teacher (רב מובהק) and his disciple — P.Teah. A wealthy individual who is known as a stern person38e., all fear him and are partial towards him. Cf. supra n. 15 and § 13, n. 27 end. This applies equally whether he is the plaintiff or the defendant and despite the fact that the members of the local Court are very learned, — for we apprehend that because of his influential position they will not render an impartial verdict. However, if he is not a powerful person but is only highly respected in his city on account of his wealth or wisdom and his fellow-litigant demands to be tried in another city, then it depends upon the discretion of the Judges, viz., that if they really feel that they might be partial towards him, he may be compelled to attend Court in another city; if not, they try him here — P.Tesh., A.H. in his home town, is taken out to be tried in another city, although the Court of Law in his home town is more eminent.39Benjamin Ze’eb s. 418 — G.",

Sheb. 31a: ‘Whence do we know that if two come to Court, one (of the litigants) clad in rags and the other in a fine robe worth a hundred Manehs, they (the Judges) should say to him (the one who is well dressed), Either dress like him, or dress him like you (so that the Judges should not be biassed in your favour and the poorly clad person become not disheartened)? — Because it is said: From a false matter keep far (Ex. XXIII, 7). When they (the litigants) would come before Raba b. R. Huna, he used to say to them, Take off your fine shoes and come down for judgment.’ The same reasoning applies in the present ruling so that we should not be suspected of being biassed in favour of the scholar’s presentation of the case. Hence, the scribe should not mention the names of the litigants. However, the scholar should not write himself even if he does not mention his name because the Court might recognize the scholar’s handwriting. We do not apprehend that the Court in examining the arguments and the evidence submitted, even if the scholar’s name is not mentioned, will conclude that one of the litigants is a scholar since the latter’s presentation was lengthy and the other’s was brief, — because they will merely think that the illiterate person engaged a mandatory to write for him or that the Court itself wrote for him. Or it is quite possible that as long as the Court that is being consulted is not aware of the scholar’s name, no suspicion is entertained — M.E.

Derived from San. 23a: ‘R. Papa said: It may refer … e.g., to the Courts of R. Huna and R. Ḥisda. For he (the debtor) may say, Am I putting you to any trouble?’ This means that although the borrower is servant to the lender and cannot put the creditor to trouble in choosing the locale of judgment, yet, when the two Courts are so close to each other as those of R. Huna and R. Ḥisda, the objection of the creditor to the debtor’s choice of locale is not valid. The Court of R. Ḥisda was not as renowned as that of R. Huna (cf. B.M. 33a; San. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. כגון). Consequently, each litigant can reject the Court chosen by the other litigant and they must choose a Court that is acceptable to both.

Ar. and Tur. the verdict against him [the litigant], he is required to inform him the grounds on which he made his decision, even if he [the litigant] did not ask for [this].46Tur. Derived from B.M. 69a-b: ‘Two Cutheans (members of the sect of Samaritans) entered into a partnership (one investing money, and the other trading with it). Then one went and divided the money without consulting his partner. They appeared before R. Papa. Said he to him (the claimant): What is the difference? Thus stated R. Naḥman: Monies are considered to be already divided. The following year they bought wine in partnership. Consequently, the other arose and divided it without the knowledge of his partner. Again they appeared before R. Papa. Said he to him: Who divided it for you? — I notice, he answered, that you are prejudiced in my partner’s favour (because last year you considered his division valid, whereas this year you are opposed to mine). Said R. Papa: In such a case (where the litigant doubts my impartiality) it is necesary to inform him (my reasons): With respect to coins, Would he take good ones and leave defective ones (for you)? But regarding wine, everyone knows that there is wine that is sweet and there is wine that is not sweet (hence no biassed division is possible in the case of money as there might be in the case of wine).’ Hence, the present ruling. Thus also Tosaf. ibid. s.v. כי and Asheri on the principle then ye shall be clear before the Lord and before Israel (Num. XXXII, 22). This should be done only where there is suspicion of partiality. But where there could be no suspicion entertained and the litigant merely derides the verdict, they may pronounce the ban against him (N.Yos.) — M.E. Gloss: And so much the more if he [the litigant] said: 'Write down the grounds on which you made your decision [and give them to me].'47Tur — G. e., if in the case of one who did not ask for the grounds of the verdict, the law is that if the Judge feels that he is being suspected of partiality, he must state the reasons which led to his decision, then much more so in the case of one who demands this that we must grant him his request — M.E. , San. 31b and Tosaf. s.v. ואם. However, some say [that this is applicable] only if they tried him by using means of coercion [for him to appear in Court], but otherwise, they do not write down [the grounds of their verdict], and thus is the fundamental principle.48Mord.; N.Yos. to San. III; Tosaf. and RaN to B.M. V — G. For if the litigants appeared for trial willingly, then it means that they accepted the Judges as authoritative. Nevertheless, where the litigant appeared for trial willingly and still asks for the written grounds of the verdict, it must be given to him, for as we have already seen that even in a case where the Court notices that the litigant suspects them of partiality, they must give the grounds of the verdict — M.E. , San. 31b and Tosaf. s.v. ואם. When they are required to write down for him the grounds on which they made their decision, there is no fixed time for this matter, but whenever he [the litigant] comes [and requests the Court] to write down for him [the grounds of their verdict], they write [them] down and give [them] to him.49Mord. to San. III end — G. Derived from Mishna San. 31a: ‘Whenever he produces proof, it (the Court) can reverse the verdict.’ So too, in the present case, whenever he says to the Judges, ‘Write down the grounds for your verdict,’ they must give them to him. It is not necessary to write down for him the reasons and the proof [which led to their decision], [but] only the pleas [of the litigants] and the verdict [of the Judges] are recorded for them [the litigants].50N.Yos. ibid. — G. For every competent Court of Law upon hearing the pleas would know the grounds on which the decision was made since we all possess the same Torah — M.E. Although the grounds for the verdict are not written down, they may be given orally — P.Tesh. [The guilty party] is required to make payment forthwith and if [he subsequently produces proof] to reverse the verdict, they return to him [whatever they exacted from him].51Mord. to B.B. III; Hag. Maim. to Yad, Sanhedrin VI; MaHaRIK Rt. 1; B.Yos. on the authority of R. Mordekai b. Hillel — G. The money is exacted immediately and given to the claimant. Although this ruling has already been stated by Caro in par. 1 supra, nevertheless, since we might say that Caro refers to exacting the money but retaining it until final word is received from the other Court of Law which is being consulted, Isserles therefore, informs us here that the guilty party is required to pay the claimant forthwith — M.E. They are required to write down for him [the grounds of their verdict] only [if this information is requested] of a minor Court [and is being sent for reconsideration] to a Higher Court, but where a Higher Court tried a case, it is not necessary to write [this] down for him because we do not apprehend any error [in the verdict], for if so, there is no end to the matter.52B.Yos. stating that thus it appears from the words of Maim — G.

    "text_en": "One who is found guilty by law is legally not bound to compensate his opponent for the expenditure he incurred although he compelled him to be tried in another city.53Tur, Asheri and Mord. Derived from San. 31b: R. Eleazar said in his presence (v. complete text supra n. 13), Rabbi! One who has a claim against his neighbour in the amount of a Maneh, must he expend another Maneh in addition to the (first) Maneh (in traveling expenses)?’ This, however, is the case only where he [the defendant] does not refuse to stand in judgment, only that he desires to be tried in another city; but if he [the defendant] refused to come to the Court of Law and the claimant was obliged to incur expenditure [in order] to compel him to go down to Court, he [the defendant] is legally bound to pay him [the claimant] all his expenses54Derived from B.K. 112b. , text supra § 8, 5, n. 45 and cf. supra § 11, 1. This means if the defendant was declared guilty (RIBaSh, D.M.) — M.E. But if the defendant was acquitted, then the law is that if the claimant made a false claim and consequently the defendant was justified in refusing to stand trial, the latter is not obliged to pay the expenses incurred. However, if the claimant did not act falsely but only thought that his claim was justified, the defendant must pay, for in any case he should not have refused to appear for trial. In order to ascertain the veracity of the claimant we rely upon the understanding of the Judges — Tummim, Nethiboth, A.H. We deal here only with expenditure incurred as a result of the defendant’s refusal (סרבנות), but other expenses, such as, sending a messenger to collect the money, the defendant is not obliged to pay — ShaK. which he incurred from the moment he becomes a refuser.55MaHaRIK, Rt. 1 and 144; N.Yos. to B.K. X; MaHaRIW; Asheri, Resp. Rule 108 and 73, s. 2 — G. If the defendant states that the claimant did not summon him to Court and the claimant produced witnesses to prove that he did summon the defendant and subsequently the defendant stated that he was summoned but that he did not refuse to appear for trial, he is presumed to be a liar and must make payment. And if before the claimant’s witnesses appeared, the defendant admitted that he was summoned only that he did not refuse to appear, the law is that if the defendant’s admission was not on account of his fear of the witnesses, he is believed (v. B.K. 75a); but if it was made on account of his fear of the witnesses, the law is doubtful whether he is believed or not (ספיקא דדינא) — ShaK. Cf. infra § 79, 9, Gloss. There is an authority who states that if he summoned him through the civil courts56Heb. ערכאות from Greek ἀρχἠ, ἀρχεȋον, ‘office,’ ‘registry,’ ‘magistracy.’ and incurred [thereby] expenditure by [engaging] Judges and pleaders, [then the law is that] although on account of his [the defendant's] refusal [to appear] he [the claimant] was obliged to take him [to law] through the [heathen] civil courts,56Heb. ערכאות from Greek ἀρχἠ, ἀρχεȋον, ‘office,’ ‘registry,’ ‘magistracy.’ [nevertheless] he [the defendant] is legally not bound to pay his [the claimant's] expenses.57RIBaSh s. 475, since this is only regarded as a secondary cause of damage (גרמא) because it was only through his refusal that expenditure was incurred by the claimant (v. supra § 1, n. 35) and the defendant’s act of refusal was not an immediate cause of the expenses and the law is that a secondary cause in a case of damage carries no liability (B.K. 60a). For the difference between Gerama (indirect or secondary) and Garmi (direct or immediate) damage, v. Asheri B.B. II, 17. Tosaf., B.B. 22b, s.v. זאת אומרת state two distinctions between Gerama and Garmi: Gerama refers a) to indirect cause of damage resulting through the agency of others, or b) resulting subsequent to the act performed. Garmi refers a) to direct cause of damage when acting himself or b) damage caused simultaneously with the act performed. The defendant’s act of refusal comes under the category of Gerama. This is in accord with R. Isaac in Tosaf. ibid. Cf. also supra § 1, n. 35 Gloss: Some differ [with this ruling] and are of the opinion that if he [the claimant] was obliged to incur expenditure on account of him, [viz.,] to compel him [to appear for trial] through heathen civil courts,56Heb. ערכאות from Greek ἀρχἠ, ἀρχεȋον, ‘office,’ ‘registry,’ ‘magistracy.’ he [the defendant] is legally bound to compensate him,58Asheri Resp. Rule 73, s. 2 — G. This represents the view of RIZBA in Tosaf. ibid., viz., that the liability of Garmi is of a penal nature (קנס). Consequently, any sort of damage that is of frequent occurrence is punishable. Hence, the ruling here. and thus seems to me to be the fundamental principle provided that he [the claimant] executed this with the permission of the [Jewish] Court of Law as stated infra § 26.59Where, however, he did not obtain permission from the Jewish Court of Law to summon the recalcitrant defendant to appear before the civil authorities, even where this permission is not necessary, e.g., if the claimant produces a written document in which he is given the right to sue the defendant, if necessary, before the civil courts (v. infra § 26, 4, Gloss), nevertheless, since the claimant obtained no permission from the Beth Din, the defendant is exempt from paying the expenses — R.A.Eger, P.Tesh. One who says to his fellow [-litigant] that they should go and be tried in another locality and the latter said to him, 'Go, and I will come after you,' and [then] he departed, but the other one [who promised to come after him] did not follow him, — [the law is that] he must pay the one who went [there] all his expenses.60Mord. to San. III end — G. On the basis of this ruling, Ḥawwoth Ya’ir states that if A invited B to bring his son on a set day for the purpose of marriage and when the appointed day arrived, B failed to come with his son, while A incurred expenditure for all the wedding preparations, the law is that if B is unable to advance a valid excuse for not coming, he must defray all the expenses that were incurred by A — P.Tesh. When the one who refuses [to go to law] is required to pay the expenses, we do not say that [the claimant] should take an oath as to how much he has spent, but he must verify how much expenditure he has incurred [and receive compensation], or the Court of Law assess for him his expenditure and in accordance with this [assessment] he [the defendant] compensates him.61Asheri Resp. Rule 107 — G. Mishna Ket. 79b where we see that only where one had a right to incur expenditure he may take an oath as to how much he has spent and receives compensation. We-Shab ha-Kohen explains Isserles’ Gloss as follows: Both where the claimant can or cannot verify the expenditure incurred, assessment by Court is still required, viz., if the claimant verifies the expenditure incurred, the assessment is made by Court in order to determine whether the claimant incurred more expenses than necessary (v. infra § 182, 3, Gloss); but if the claimant cannot verify the amount expended, then the Court’s assessment should be fixed on the basis of the lowest expenditure (v. infra § 375, 8). Isserles’ ruling, ‘But he must ascertain how much expenditure he incurred,’ means that the Court must then make an assessment in order to determine whether more expenditure than necessary was incurred. Isserles does not state this explicitly because he relies on his ruling infra § 182, 3, Gloss. For it goes without saying that more expenses than necessary should not be incurred. And as to the latter part of Isserles’ ruling, viz., ‘Or the Court of Law assess for him his expenditure and in accordance with this (assessment) he (the defendant) compensates him,’ it refers to a case where the claimant cannot verify the expenditure incurred — P.Tesh.",

    "text_en": "The Judge is required to give priority to the adjudication of a lawsuit that comes before him first [in order];1San. 8a: ‘Ye shall hear the small and the great alike (Deut. I, 17). Resh Lakish stated: (This verse intimates) that a lawsuit of a Perutah should be regarded by you as equally important as one involving a hundred Maneh. For what practical issue is this law stated? If it is to insist that we study the case carefully, is this not obvious! Rather, it is to give preference to the case if it is first in order.’ ‘A lawsuit that comes before him first (in order),’ means that the litigant pleaded his case first and the Judge prepared himself to listen to his case although the claim may have been filed in Court later — M.E. but he must give priority to a lawsuit of a scholar2Whether he is the claimant or the defendant — K.H., A.H. Derived from Sheb. 30a: ‘R. ‘Ulla, the son of R. Elai had a case before R. Naḥman. R. Joseph sent (a communication) to him (R. Naḥman): Our friend ‘Ulla is a fellowman (i.e., a colleague, a scholar) in Torah and precepts. Said (R. Naḥman): Why did he send (this communication) to me? (Did he mean) that I should favour him in Court? (Certainly not!) Then he (R. Naḥman) said: (Perhaps he meant) that I should decide his case first (so as not to detain him); or, (with respect to) discretionary judgment (i.e., to which of the claimants to adjudicate the claim in a case that does not depend on witnesses or an oath but rather on the discretion of the Judges. R. Joseph, therefore suggested that if ‘Ulla’s case was of such a nature, then because he was a scholar he should give preference to his case).’ The latter alternative possibility is omitted here because we rule today that in matters pertaining to the descretion of the Judges (שודא דדייני) the Judge must be a Mumḥeh (v. Glos.). , infra § 240, 3, Gloss and Ket. 94b, Tosaf. s.v. אימיה. even if it comes last [in order].3In accord with the second interpretation of Sheb. 30a, Tosaf. s.v. למישרי because the positive precept of showing respect for the Torah takes precedence over the positive precept Ye shall hear the small and the great alike. So too, is he [the Judge] religiously dutibound to seek whatever [points] he can [find] in his [the scholar's] favour.4Shab. 119a: ‘Raba said: May I receive Divine reward for that when a disciple appeared before me with a lawsuit I did not rest my head upon my pillow before I had found (points) to his advantage (not as a result of partiality but rather because a scholar would not come with a lawsuit unless he was sure that he had a just claim).’ , Sheb. 30a, Tosaf. s.v. למאי. The majority of Codifiers rule that nowadays, too, a scholar enjoys this privilige — P.Tesh., A.H. a.o. Gloss: And if the scholar himself [appears] before the Judges, [then] even [if] they had already begun [to adjudicate] another lawsuit, they should judge him [the scholar] first, so that he should not be disturbed from his studies.5, B.B. 22a whence we see that in the case of scholars or Rabbis we adopt leniencies so that they should not be disturbed from their studies. However, if his [the scholar's] relative appeared for trial, [then] if they had [already] begun [to adjudicate] another lawsuit, there is no need to interrupt [the adjudication]; but if they had not [begun], they [the Judges] must judge him [the relative] first on account of showing respect for the scholar.6B.Yos. on the authority of RITBA — G. , Ket. 106a whence we derive that one must also give priority to the lawsuit of a scholar’s relative. Hence, the law is that when the scholar himself appears in Court, or sends a mandatory to replace him, or informs the Court of Law that he is sending his relative to be tried, although the latter’s case has nothing to do with the scholar, we give priority to the scholar or his relative. However, if the scholar’s relative came with a lawsuit and the scholar did not inform the Court concerning his relative’s case, he has no priority rights, for in this case we are not obliged to show respect for the scholar’s relative save in the case of the scholar’s wife who enjoys the same privileges as her husband — A.H.",

    "text_en": "[If] before him [the Judge] there were many lawsuits [awaiting a legal decision],7The laws of precedence here are applicable only when they all appeared simultaneously in Court, but if one appeared first, he receives precedence save in the case of a scholar versus an illiterate person where the law is that even if he appeared last, he receives precedence (v. par 1 supra). we give priority to the orphan's lawsuit over the lawsuit of the widow,8Tur citing Yad, Sanhedrin XXI, 6. Derived from Judge the orphan, plead for the widow (Is. I, 17) quoted by Yad, ibid. Cf. however, Ye shall not afflict any widow or orphan (Ex. XXI, 21) where the widow is placed before the orphan. This presents no difficulty because the latter text speaks of affliction of the widow or orphan who are forlorn and heartbroken (v. Yad, De‘oth VI, 10) in which case the widow suffers more than the orphan (cf. San. 22b: ‘The death of a man is felt by none than his wife’). But young orphans are not mature enough to realize the gravity of their loss. Hence, in this respect the Bible gives priority to the widow. However, in the case of a lawsuit the orphans are weaker than the widow. Consequently, the orphans receive precedence — Be’er Eliyahu. and the lawsuit of the widow takes precedence over the lawsuit of a Scholar,9Whence it follows that the lawsuit of an orphan certainly takes precedence over that of a Scholar which contradicts the ruling in par. 1 supra which is derived from Ket. 105b-106a: where it is related that R. Anan who once accepted a gift (v. reason a.l) from a man who brought a lawsuit to him sent the latter to R. Naḥman to whom he also sent (the following communication): ‘Will the Master adjudicate (the case of) this man because I, Anan, am ineligible to act as Judge for him. Since he dispatched such a message to me, (R. Naḥman) thought, he must be his (R. Anan’s) relative (and one is forbidden to act as Judge or witness in a relative’s action). An orphan’s lawsuit was going on before him and he pondered: This one (i.e., to judge an orphan) is a positive precept and that one (to show respect for a Scholar and consequently, for his relative too) is also a positive precept, but the positive precept of showing respect for the Torah (i.e., for a Scholar on account of his learning) takes precedence. Consequently he put aside the orphan’s lawsuit and placed before him that man’s suit. When the other litigant noticed the honour he (R. Naḥman) was showing him (his opponent whom R. Naḥman thought was R. Anan’s relative) he had nothing to say (i.e., he was intimidated).’ In order to remove the contradiction between the present ruling and that of par. 1 supra the following point should be made: In par. 1 we deal with a case where the legal guardian (אפוטרופוס) of the orphans brought the lawsuit. This is substantiated by the expression דינא דיתמי (not והוו יתמי קמיה) employed in Ket. ibid., the source of the ruling that we give priority to the Scholar’s lawsuit; in the present ruling we refer to the orphans themselves who appeared in Court — Be’er Eliyahu. and the lawsuit of a Scholar takes precedence over the lawsuit of an illiterate person,10, supra n.  and the lawsuit of a woman takes priority over the lawsuit of a man.11Yeb. 100a: ‘In former times, when a man and a woman (with different lawsuits) appeared before me for a legal decision, I used to settle the man’s lawsuit first, because I was of the opinion that a man (should receive precedence) being subject to the fulfilment of all the commandments (a woman is exempt from some); when, however, I heard this (the reason why a woman should be given her share of the poor man’s tithe first. , Gem. a.l), I settle a woman’s lawsuit first. Why! So as to save her from degradation (it would be a degradation for her to have to wait her turn in a company of men).’",

[of responsibility], i.e., the chain of guilt, will hang around the neck of the witnesses.'13Yad, Sanhedrin XXIV,  Derived from Sheb. 30b-31a: ‘Whence do we know that a Judge who knows that a lawsuit is fraudulent (having reached a conclusion from the testimony of the witnesses that they spoke falsely), should not say, Since the witnesses bear testimony, I will decide the case (in accordance with their testimony) and the collar (of responsibility) will hang around the neck of the witnesses? — For it is said: From a false matter keep far (Ex. XXIII, 7).’ In what manner should he act? — He should investigate and inquire into the matter closely by means of [the methods employed in the] cross-examination and investigation of capital cases.14San. 32b: ‘R. Papa stated (in reconciling the views of the Mishna [San. 32a] that both monetary and capital cases require examination and inquiry, and the Baraitha [ibid.] according to which examination and inquiry in civil suits are not necessary) … In our Mishna the lawsuit is fraudulent (therefore, there must be a thorough examination and investigation), but in the other (Baraitha) the lawsuit is not fraudulent. This accords with Resh Lakish, for Resh Lakish pointed out an incongruity (between two verses): It is written, In justice (E. ‘righteousness’) shalt thou judge thy neighbour (Lev. XIX, 15); and (elsewhere) it is written, Justice, justice shalt thou follow (Deut. XVI, 20. The repetition of the word justice indicates a more thorough investigation). How is this possible? — The latter verse refers to a lawsuit that is fraudulent; the former verse to a lawsuit that is not fraudulent.’ However, this passage contradicts the passage in Sheb. ibid. (v. previous note) according to which the Judge is required to withdraw from adjudicating a fraudulent lawsuit. There are in the main three views held among the Codifiers in order to reconcile these two Talmudic sources. a) Tosaf. (San. 32b, s.v. כאן) maintain that in Sheb. we deal with a lawsuit that we know to be fraudulent. Hence, the Judge is obliged to withdraw from such a case; while in San. we deal with a lawsuit that is suspected of being fraudulent. Consequently, examination and inquiry are required in order to determine for certain the fraudulence in the case. b) Maim. (Yad, ibid.) holds that both in Sheb. and San. we deal with a fraudulent lawsuit only that in Sheb. examination and inquiry had already been applied (note the expression ‘A Judge who knows that a lawsuit is fraudulent).’ Consequently, we apply the verse, From a false matter keep far and the Judge must withdraw from the case. In San., however, we deal with a fraudulent lawsuit where examination and inquiry were not conducted as yet. Accordingly, there is no difference whether the plaintiff made a fraudulent claim or whether the defendant presents a dishonest case, — the Judge must withdraw. And although the defendant may benefit according to this view, nevertheless, we are not responsible (This perhaps explains the version found in some texts of Yad ibid.: וידון אותו מלכו של עולם ‘Let the King of the world judge him’ instead of וידוננו מי שלבו שלם ‘One whose heart [intelligence] is perfect should judge it.’ In other words, even if the defendant will benefit, the ‘King of the universe’ will eventually see that justice is carried out). c) Asheri reconciles the passages as follows: In Sheb. the plaintiff is the one who makes the false plea. Therefore, the Judge should withdraw; while in San. we deal with a case where the defendant is a fraudulent person. Hence, in order for the latter not to benefit, the Judge must not withdraw. , infra par. 4. Gloss: Nevertheless, the law [of cross-examination in this case] is not [as strict] as [in] capital cases where if [a witness] stated during one of the inquiries, 'I know not,' that the testimony becomes void; but what is meant to be said is that he [the Judge] should inquire into a fraudulent lawsuit as much as it is possible.15RIBaSh s. 266 — G. If it appears to him [the Judge] according to his understanding that there is fraud therein, or where his common sense [directs him] not to rely upon the statements of the witnesses although he cannot [find grounds] to disqualify them, or where his [practical] judgment inclines [to assume] that this litigant is a deceiver and a cunning person and mislead the witnesses although they are eligible [witnesses] and gave evidence in ignorance of its legal bearing, and this party [the deceiving litigant] led them astray, or it appears to him [the Judge] from the general contents of the statements that there are other concealed matters therein and they are not willing to reveal them, — [then the law is that in] all these [aforementioned] matters and anything similar to these, he is forbidden to render a legal decision in that lawsuit, but he should withdraw from this case and one whose heart [intelligence] is perfect in [the examination of] such a case should judge it and these are matters entrusted to the heart [intelligence].16Yad ibid. followed by Tur who also cite, For the judgment is G-d’s (Deut. I, 17). When Asheri would notice on the basis of a well-grounded assumption that the lawsuit is fraudulent, he would prepare a document and place [it] in the possession of the defendant [to the effect] that no Judge should make an effort to try this lawsuit.",

When (the man was) lying on his deathbed, he said, I leave all my possessions to one son. They knew not to which of them he referred, so they appeared before R.

Thereupon they all went to do so. But the one who was really his son did not go. Whereupon (R. Bana’ah) said to them, All the possessions belong to this one. They went and informed against him (R. Bana’ah) before the king, saying, There is a man among the Jews who exacts money illegally from people without witnesses or any other proof. So they brought him (R. Bana’ah) and imprisoned him etc.’ R. Bana’ah based his opinion on a well-grounded assumption (אומדנא דמוכח) that the real son was the one who did not go to knock at the grave of his father (v.

Derived from Ket. 85a: ‘A certain woman was declared bound to take an oath in the Court of Raba, but when the daughter of R. Ḥisda (Raba’s wife) said to him, I know that she is suspected of swearing falsely, Raba transferred the oath to her opponent (cf. Sheb. 44b where the claimant in such a case receives the amount claimed on confirmation by oath).’ Cf. ibid. a and b for similar cases. However, from the time that Courts of Law [whose members] are not virtuous, — [and were they even virtuous in their deeds, are not sufficiently learned],23Thus Maim. in Yad ibid. XXIV, 2. nor possess understanding, — became numerous, they agreed not to transfer an oath [to an opponent] save on [the basis of] clear evidence,24Yad ibid. XXIV, 2. Thus also Alfasi to Ket. ibid. For this applies only in the case of R. Ḥisda’s daughter where Raba was certain that he could rely upon her evidence and therefore transferred the oath although he had no substantial proof for acting thus, but not nowadays. MaHaRIK Rt. 108 writes that even nowadays the Judge is dutibound to judge in accordance with the facts which appear to him as true and not in accordance with the pleas of the litigants if they contradict the truth. Thus also RaShBA in Resp. — M.E., ShaK. , also P.Tesh that nowadays one may judge on the basis of a well-grounded assumption. nor to impair a bond and [thereby] cause damage to its legal status on the testimony of a woman or a relative,25Ket. ibid.: ‘Once R. Papa and R. Adda b. Mattena sat before him (Raba) when they brought a certain bond before him. Said R. Papa to him, I know this bond has been paid up. Is there (Raba) asked him, any other person with the Master (to substantiate your statement)? No, he answered. Said the other to him, Although the Master is present (to offer testimony, the evidence of) one witness is legally not binding (Alfasi, Asheri and R. Isaiah Trani omit ‘one … binding.’ In accordance with the latter reading Raba required the corroborative testimony of another person because R. Papa was a relative to one of the contesting parties. , Tosaf. Caro follows this latter reading). Said R. Adda b. Mattena to him, Should not R. Papa be (regarded as trustworthy) as the daughter of R. Ḥisda (whose evidence was considered adequate to invalidate the defendant from taking an oath)? — (As far as) the daughter of R. Ḥisda (is concerned) I am certain of her (i.e., I deem her evidence reliable); I am not certain, however, about the Master (because he is related to one of the parties. This follows Alfasi’s reading supra). Said R. Papa, Now that the Master has stated (that the assertion of a Judge), I am certain of a person is considered reliable, I would tear up a bond on the testimony of my son Abba Mar of whose trustworthiness I am certain. I would tear up! Is that imaginable (certainly the testimony of two witnesses is required)? — But (what he meant was), I would impair a bond on his testimony (i.e., the one who produces the bond would have to substantiate the contents thereof by taking an oath before payment could be demanded — Tosaf.).’ although his [practical] judgment [is inclined to] rely on their statements.26Note the expression ‘I am certain’ employed in Ket. ibid. Consequently, if the evidence of R. Papa who was referred to by Rabba as a very learned and wise man (v. Men. 71a; Nid. 12b on the expression סודני in accord with the interpretation of Rashi and R. Gershon) was not deemed reliable, much more so nowadays we cannot rely on such evidence even if we are certain that it is trustworthy. , however, supra n. 24 end. Thus too, we do not make orphans surrender [aught nowadays] save on [the basis of] clear evidence,27, infra § 297, 1 where this ruling is explained. Cf. Ket. 85b where a number of cases are reported that when a person dies intestate and a claim is made against the orphans to return a deposit, which the latter maintain might have belonged to the deceased from whom they inherited it, the law is that a) if the deceased was not a wealthy man and consequently could not have been the owner of the deposit, and b) the claimant indicates identification marks, and c) the depositor was not a frequent visitor at the house of the bailee and did not see the deposit, — we return the deposit to the claimant, but not nowadays. Alfasi and Asheri maintain that even today this ruling would be in force. Hence, it is not understandable why Isserles does not report their ruling in the present par. — M.E. nor [do we make them surrender aught] on [the basis of] the knowledge of the Judge,28As stated in Ket. 85b where the expression ‘I know that he (the person who died intestate) was not wealthy’ (ידענא ביה דלא אמיד) is employed, i.e., the Judge himself must be certain and even witnesses are not accepted (v. infra § 297, derived from Yad, She’elah VI, 4. Cf. Maggid Mishneh a.l.). For according to Alfasi, Maim. a.o. the principle of שודא דדייני i.e., a decision based on the discretion of the Judges means that the Judge must be personally acquainted with the facts. nor [on grounds of] the financial position of the deceased29As stated in Ket. ibid.: ‘I know that he (the deceased) was not wealthy.’ This, however, is no proof because a person may appear to be poor but in reality is wealthy or may have received the object as a gift. or the claimant.30As stated ibid.: ‘Who indicates identification marks.’ Nevertheless, if a reliable person offered testimony in any one of the [aforementioned] matters and the [practical] judgment of the Judge inclined [to assume] that [whatever] he [the witness] is stating [is] the truth,31Alfasi to Ket. ibid. The Judge himself must be certain that the witness is a reliable person. — [the law is that] he [the Judge] should be patient in giving his decision and should not dismiss his testimony but should discuss [the matter] with the litigants until they confess to the statements of the witness32, supra par. 3 and notes on a ‘fraudulent lawsuit’ in accord with Maim. and he [the Judge] should examine and inquire [into the case] until [the veracity of] the matter is established,32, supra par. 3 and notes on a ‘fraudulent lawsuit’ in accord with Maim. or [until] they [the litigants] make a settlement by arbitration,33, supra § 12, 5, and notes. or [until] the Judge withdraws from the lawsuit as has been explained [supra].32, supra par. 3 and notes on a ‘fraudulent lawsuit’ in accord with Maim. Gloss: If it becomes apparent to the Court of Law that one [of the litigants] robbed his fellow, but legally they cannot compel him to surrender it [the object acquired illegitimately], — [the law is that] they can issue a decree against other people not to have any dealings with him, and if it is a woman, — that she be not married to any man nor should they conduct negotiations preliminary to her betrothal until she surrenders that which does not belong to her.34Decisions of Isserlein s. 260 and v. infra § 358, 5 — G.",

    "text_en": "[If] one of the litigants1Whether the claimant or the defendant. said, '[Give me an extension of time because] I can produce witnesses,' they allow him thirty days,2B.K. 112b: ‘Raba said: The law is that a document may be verified by its signatories even not in the presence of the other party; and even if he cries aloud before us (that the document was forged). But if he says, Give me time until I can produce witnesses, and I will impair the document, we allow him time (generally thirty days — B.M. 118a).’ If the defendant is willing to take an oath but the claimant would rather wait until he produces his witnesses or other evidence, we grant him a postponement of thirty days only (v. infra par. 2), provided the property of the defendant depreciates in value (i.e., where he must sell his estate at a high price and should there be any delay in the settlement of his counter-claim, this opportunity would not present itself later); but if, as a result of the postponement, the defendant’s property does not depreciate in value, we allow the claimant an unlimited extension of time. Should, however, the claimant not state that he can verify the matter were he to be given more time, and the property of the defendant depreciates in value, the law is that even the thirty days are not given — M.E. Cf. infra § 24. The extension of thirty days is given to people in general, but if it is definitely knows that the litigant is a powerful person who defies the law, v. infra § 98, 4 — M.E. and after thirty days [if no witnesses were produced by him], they issue the verdict, and he is obliged to make payment.3Mord. to San. III end — G. Or if the defendant is willing to take an oath and thus be exempt he may do so. Cf. also supra § 14,  If, however, he produces them [the witnesses] later, it [the Court] can upset the verdict.4Mishna San. 31a: ‘Whenever he (any of the litigants) can produce proof, the Court can reverse the verdict. However, if they said to him, Produce all the proofs that you may have within thirty days, and he produced them within thirty days, the Court reverses the verdict; but (if he produced proof) after thirty days, the Court cannot upset the verdict. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel stated: What should he do who did not find (evidence) within the thirty days but found it after thirty days?’ The present ruling is in accord with Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel. Cf. also infra § 87, 30. If it is well known to the Court of Law that So-and-so are witnesses in the matter but they have moved far away, he is given time until he can produce [them].5Thus Asheri in Resp. Derived from B.K. 46b: ‘R. Naḥman stated on the authority of Rabbah b. Abbuha: Whence do we know that the Court should attend to the first claimant (i.e., when A brought legal proceedings against B [and according to some versions of Rashi, A has witnesses or a document substantiating his claim, so that B cannot say that he paid] and the latter made a counter-claim against A. Thus Rashi. Tosaf. [according to one interpretation] s.v. שאין, explain as follows. After A instituted an action against B, the latter stated that there were witnesses available at the time of the act who could corroborate his counter-claim, and we deal here with a case where the Court also knows that witnesses were available at the time of the act. Consequently, were it not for the Biblical text [v. anon] we might have said that under these circumstances the Court should give him ample time until he produces the witnesses. Therefore, we are informed that this is not so, but we give prior consideration to A’s claim)? — For it is said: If any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them (Ex. XXIV, 14), (i.e.,) let him cause his matters to come (first) before them.’ Tosaf. ibid. (according to a second interpretation) explain that we deal here with a case where A claims that B injured him, and B advances a counter-claim, in which case the law is that A’s claim is given prior consideration even if B states that he can produce witnesses in a day or two — because no extension of time is given in the case of injury (B.K. 91a). Tosaf. accept the second interpretation, viz., that we deal here with cases of injury. Consequently, the above verse refers only to cases of injury. Hence, according to the first interpretation of Tosaf. to which the above verse does not apply, B would be given time until he can produce his witnesses. This is the source of Caro’s text on the authority of Asheri. Thus W.G. , Be’er Eliyahu. Likewise if it is known to the Court of Law that he can verify his statements within the thirty [days], they do not give him [additional] time for nothing.6B.Yos. on the authority of RITBA — G. , B.M. 118a, Tosaf. s.v. זמן end. This ruling means that even where no loss would be sustained by the fellow-litigant were we to give the claimant an extension of time. Even if we are not aware whether he deliberately wishes to postpone the case for the present or not, but we know that his opponent suffers a loss thereby, the law is that he must produce evidence within thirty days — M.E., ShaK. , infra § 98, 4.",

Isaiah. when they [the Judges] summoned him at first without evidence [submitted by the claimant] and the Court of Law [issued a verdict and] required him [the defendant] to take an oath, while the other party [the claimant] pleads, 'I have evidence, but it is not in my possession at present, and I desire not to accept his [the defendant's] oath,'9Although the claimant may produce witnesses or other proof subsequent to the oath and thus upset the verdict (v. supra par. 1), nevertheless, if we wait until he produces proof, the defendant might confess, but not if he had already taken the oath — M.E. then [the law is that] they give him a period of thirty days [to produce the evidence]. However, if he [the claimant] pleaded at first [i.e., before the verdict was given], 'I have evidence, but it is not in my possession at present,' [then] what need is there to grant him time10Likewise in the case of one who pleaded that he lost his bonds through unavoidable circumstances and it is impossible for him to produce them because of the distance involved in order to obtain them (RIBaSh) — M.E. [to produce the evidence]? [Consequently, the law is that only] when he [the claimant] produces [it], the defendant must respond to him [the claimant], and as long as he [the claimant] produces no [evidence], he [the defendant] must not respond to him [by making] any [counter-] plea. If he [the claimant] returned and stated, 'I have no evidence,' he [the defendant] responds to him without [producing] any evidence11As in the case of all oral claims. [to substantiate his counter-plea]. There is an authority who states that he [the defendant] takes an oath and is exempt and [if the claimant] still [promises] to produce evidence, he is not relied upon.12 Mishna San. 31a: ‘If they said to him, Bring witnesses, and he answered, I have no witnesses, or (if they said), Bring proof, and he said, I have no proof, and subsequently he produced proof or found witnesses, it has no legal effect (since he might have produced false witnesses or brought a forged document). Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: What should he do who did not know that witnesses were available, but found them later, or who did not know that he had proof, but found it later (consequently, both the proof and the witnesses should be accepted)?’ The law in this case rests with the First Tanna. Hence, the ruling here. By stating the ruling here in the name of ‘some say,’ Caro disagrees with it, although none of the Codifiers question this law. It is quite possible that Caro (v. B.Yos.) contests this ruling not because the Codifiers differ with it, but rather because it is not mentioned by the latter — M.E., P.Tesh. Gloss: If the defendant requests [an extension of] time in order to respond to the plea of the claimant, [then] if it becomes apparent to the Court of Law that it is [intended] only [as] a [mere] delay [of the case], they do not grant him [an extension of] time, and he must respond forthwith. However, if it appears to the Court of Law that he does require [an extension of] time in order to examine and consider carefully the matters concerning him and the other party, they give him [an extension of] time as much as he requires.13B.Yos. on the authority of RaShBA in Resp. — G. But if in the bond [produced by the claimant] it is written that he must pay him without delay, [the law is that] every stipulation made in monetary matters is binding.14B.Yos. on the authority of RITBA — G. , B.M. 94a; Ket. 56a a.e., ‘A stipulation made in monetary matters is valid.’ The following is the full text of RITBA: ‘If in the bond it is written that he must pay him at the appointed time without delay and without any demands for an extension of time by the Court, the stipulation is binding.’",

Joshua for which an offender is exempt from the judgments of man but held responsible to the judgments of Heaven, is found the following: ‘One who knows evidence in favour of his fellow but does not testify on his behalf. What is the case before us? If a case where there are two (witnesses), is it not self-evident that it is based on a Biblical verse (why then should it be mentioned here?), (for it is written), If he do not utter it then he shall bear his iniquity (Lev. V, 1)? — It refers to a case where there is one (witness whose testimony merely imposes an oath upon the defendant — v. Sheb. 40a).’ We thus see that two witnesses who withhold evidence commit a Scriptural offence and even in the case of one witness, he is still held responsible to the judgments of Heaven. Consequently, we should do everything in our power to restrain one from transgression. , infra n. 21. even if the one who is his opponent [in Court] knows about the favourable opinion of the witnesses and the [other] evidence, he is obliged to state [it].17B.K. ibid.: ‘To hire false witnesses to give evidence (is an offence for which the offender is exempt from the judgments of Man, but is held responsible to the judgments of Heaven). What are the circumstances? If for his own benefit (i.e., in order to exact money illegally) should he not be required to pay the money (which he obtained through the false witnesses) and would he not be held responsible even to the judgments of Man? — It means for the benefit of his neighbour.’ Hence, we see that where he knows that his fellow is right, he would be liable to return the illegitimately acquired object.

However, the defendant is not required to take an oath, since the assertion of the claimant is not made with certainty. And if the person concerned pleaded with certainty that he knows that the document wherein there are [recorded] rights in his favour are in his [the other person's] possession, [then] the latter takes an equitable oath23Heb. היסת. , supra § 1, n. 2. that it is not in his possession.24Here the assertion is made with certainty.

What is considered righteousness of the Law? — It means to regard the two litigants as equals in every respect, [viz., that] one should not be permitted to speak as long as he needs and the other be told, 'Make your speech brief;'2Yad, Sanhedrin XXI,  Derived from Sheb. 30a: ‘Our Rabbis taught: In righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour (intimates) that one of the litigants should not sit and the other stand; that one be not permitted to speak as long as he needs and the other be told, Make your speech brief.’ In Y. San. III, 9(21c); Y. Sheb. IV, 1(35b) this is derived from Deut. XIX, 17: Then the two men, between whom the controversy is etc.,’ since men means at least two, consequently, two is superfluous (in addition to the fact that there are suits involving more than two litigants), but it teaches that the litigants be treated as two equals. It would likewise be forbidden even if the Judge were to say only to one of the litigants, ‘Make your speech brief,’ and not give the other litigant instructions to speak at length. However, he may say to both, ‘Make your speech brief or long — BaḤ, M.E., ShaK, A.H. [that] one should not be favourable to one [litigant] and speak soft words to him, and severe to the other [litigant] and speak harsh words to him.3Yad ibid. Derived from Tosef(Z). Sanhedrin VI, 2; Y. Sheb. IV, 1(35b); Y. Yoma VI, 1(43b): ‘He (the Judge) should not be forbearing (מאריך פנים) towards one of the litigants, nor severe (Tosef. has מעיין ‘investigative;’ Y. has מעיז פנים ‘insolent’) towards the other, for it is written, In righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.’ Cf. also Ket. 46a: ‘That text (Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people — Lev. XIX, 16) is a warning to the Court not to be lenient with one (litigant) and severe to the other.’ If one of them is wearing expensive garments and the other is wearing shabby garments, they [the Judges] should say to the one who is well dressed, 'Either dress him like you, or dress like him.'4Yad ,Sanhedrin XXI, 2. Derived from Sheb. 31a. , text supra § 14, n. 40. Nowadays we are not particular about this — RaShaL, M.E., ShaK a.o. Nor should one [litigant] sit and the other stand, but both should stand.5 supra n. 2. According to Tosef(Z). ibid.: ‘The Judge should not make one stand (מעמיד) and the other sit (מושיב),’ whence it follows that if one sits down and the other remains standing of their own accord, it would be permissible — BaḤ. This is however, rejected by Keneseth ha-Gedolah — P.Tesh. If, however, the Court of Law desires to permit them both to sit, they may do so.6Sheb. 30a: Tosef(Z). ibid. in accord with R. Judah: ‘Our Rabbis taught: And the two men shall stand (Deut. XIX, 17): it is a religious duty that the litigants stand. R. Judah stated: I heard that if they (the Judges) desire to permit them both to sit, they may do so.’ Although R. Judah represents an individual opinion and we would ordinarily rule in accordance with the Rabbis who represent the majority, nevertheless, since the second Baraitha (v. supra n. 2) and all the cases cited in Sheb. 30a,b harmonize with R. Judah’s view, the law rests with him. The litigants, however, are not permitted to sit down of their own accord, and if they did so, the Judge must ask them to rise, and subsequently, if they desire to permit them to sit, they may do so. According to this explanation it is understandable why King Jannai who was summoned to be present during the trial of his slave who killed a man (v. San. 19a) was told by Simeon b. Shetaḥ when the latter noticed that Jannai sat down after he arrived at Court, ‘Stand on your feet King Jannai and let the witnesses offer testimony against you’ (v. San. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. ינאי; Sheb. 30a, Tosaf. s.v. שאם who point out a difficulty which is removed by this explanation) — P.Tesh. Nor should one [litigant] sit on a higher level and the other on a lower level, but one next to the other.7Yad, Sanhedrin XXI, 3. Cf. Tanḥ(B). Shofetim VI to Deut. XVI, 19: Thou shalt not respect persons: ‘(This text) is a warning to the Nasi not to seat one who is worthy to be (only) on a lower level — on a higher level, and one who is worthy to be on a higher level — on a lower level.’ However, this text implies that it would be permissible to seat one on a higher level who is worthy of this honour and likewise one who only deserves to be seated on a lower level should not be seated higher than his position demands. Hence, this text contradicts our present ruling. Nevertheless, since we deal in our ruling with individuals who are considered equals, therefore our text does apply (v. ‘Eẓ Yosef in cur. edd. of Tanḥ.). Should, however, one litigant stand on a higher level and the other on a lower one, it does not matter — M.E. The underlying reason for regarding the litigants as equals is in order to avoid disheartening on the part of a litigant who is not treated as an equal and thereby forgets his pleas. When does this apply?8That if the Court desires to permit them both to sit, they may do so. — At the time of the discussion of the pleas,9Sheb. 30b: ‘R. Huna sated: The controversy of opinion is with respect to the time of the discussion (i.e., while the case is being debated), but at the time of the conclusion of the case (when the verdict is given) all agree that the Judges sit and the litigants stand, for it is written, And Moses sat to Judge the people; and the people stood (Ex. XVIII, 13).’ but at the time of the conclusion of the case, both litigants must stand in the first instance.10For in the case of witnesses it is only in the first instance that they must stand (v. infra n. 12), but if they gave their testimony while sitting, it is valid ex post facto. , Sheb. 30b: ‘Ulla stated: The controversy of opinion is with respect to the litigants, but with respect to witnesses all agree that they must stand, for it is written, And the two men shall stand … Another version (reads): The controversy of opinion is with respect to the time of discussion, but at the time of the conclusion of the case all agree that the Judges sit and the litigants stand, for witnesses are like the conclusion of the case (when they offer their testimony the case is completed), and it is written with respect to them: And the two men shall stand.’ Hence, the law that litigants must stand at the time of the conclusion of the case is derived from witnesses whose testimony is like the conclusion of the case, and therefore, the law should not be more stringent in the case of the litigants than in that of the witnesses. Consequently, as in the case of witnesses the law that testimony must be offered while standing is applicable in the first instance, but if the evidence was given while sitting it is considered valid ex post facto, so too, in the case of the litigants it is valid ex post facto if presented in a sitting position. What is considered the conclusion of the case? — [When the verdict is pronounced,] '[So-and-so, You are not guilty,' or 'So-and-so, you are guilty.'11Mishna San. 29a. , infra § 19, 1 and cf. supra § 12, 2. [With respect to] the witnesses [the law is that] in the first instance they must always [testify] while standing.12Sheb. 30b in accord with ‘Ulla. , supra n. 10; Git. 71a (ref to Mishna ibid. 67b: ‘If one is struck dumb and they said to him, Shall we write a Get for your wife? and he nodded his head, they must test him three times. If for no he said no, and for yes he said yes, they write and deliver it’): ‘In the same manner as he (one who is struck dumb) is examined with reference to a Get, so too, is he tested regarding transactions, testimony and bequests’ (cited from Tosef(Z). VII(V), 1). Testimony is explained by R. Joḥanan in Y. Git. VII, 1(48d) to refer to ‘one who offers testimony while sitting.’ This according to W.G. refers to one who is sick, since one who is struck dumb must have become so as a result of sickness and yet, we see that his testimony is considered valid through the test of nodding the head. Hence, it follows that if one testified while sitting, his testimony is considered valid ex post facto (cf. Tosef. ibid. where חולה ומשותק is mentioned). , also Zeb. 16a and Tosaf. s.v. מיושב. Gloss: And standing by being supported is indeed regarded as standing with respect to this matter.13RIBaSh s. 266 — G. Meg. 21a (ref. to Mishna: ‘One who reads the Megillah may do so while standing or sitting’): ‘A Tanna stated: This (namely, that one may read the Megillah while standing or sitting) does not apply to the Torah (the reading of the Torah in public). Whence is this derived? — R. Abbahu said: Because the Scriptural verse states, But as for thee, stand thou here by me (Deut. V, 28) … One verse states, And I sat (ואשב) in the mount (Deut. IX, 9) and another verse states, And I stood (עמדתי) in the mount (ibid. X, 10) — Rab said: He (Moses) stood when he learnt and sat when he reviewed (his learning). R. Ḥanina said: He was neither standing nor sitting but stooping.’ Hence, we see that stooping is designated neither standing nor sitting and yet the verse (I stood) refers to it as standing. Consequently, standing while leaning against something (equivalent to stooping) is still called standing. Leaning would therefore, include both standing and sitting. It is designated standing where this would be the requirement of the law as in the present ruling, and sitting where the law requires it as infra § 28, 26 where standing (in the case of Judges) by being supported is not considered standing but rather sitting in accord with the First Tanna in Zeb. 19b. Cf. E.H. § 169, 45; Zeb. 19b, Tosaf. s.v. וליתיב; Yoma 25a and Tosaf. s.v. אין; Y. Meg. IV, 1(74d). Hence, if Judges who are required to sit, stood by means of some support, or if witnesses who are required to stand, did so only by means of support, we adopt a leniency in both cases and consider standing by means of support in the case of Judges as sitting and in the case of witnesses as standing. This however, would not be valid if in the same lawsuit that is being tried both the Judges and the witnesses stood by being supported — M.E. , however, infra § 28, [26].",

Huna said: When a scholar and an illiterate person are in dispute with each other (and appear for trial), we urge the scholar to sit down; and to the illiterate person we also say, Sit down, and if he stands we do not care.’ If they told the illiterate person to be seated but the Court-messenger made him stand up, it is not obligatory for the Judge to tell him to sit down again. This is derived from Sheb. ibid.: ‘Rab b. Sherabya had a lawsuit tried before R. Papa. He told him to sit down and told his opponent also to sit down. However, the Court-messenger came and insulted (lit. ‘kicked’) the illiterate person and made him stand up and R. Papa did not say to him, Sit down. How could he act thus; will not the other’s plea be stopped up (i.e., he will be intimidated on seeing that R. Papa accords more honour to his opponent)? — R. Papa may say: He (the ignorant man) will say, He (R. Papa) has requested me to sit down, but the (court-) messenger was not appeased by me (i.e., I have not given him a gratuity, so he made me stand).’ Gloss: [When] a scholar comes to Court for trial, it is permissible to rise before him and we do not apprehend that the pleas of his opponent will be stopped up.15RaN to Sheb. IV — G. This applies only to a scholar because all know that one must rise before him and likewise to the wife of a scholar who is still living (and intimidation would not apply); but if the scholar is no longer alive, we do not accord his wife this honour.

    "text_en": "It is forbidden to the Judge to hear the words [pleas] of one litigant in the absence of his fellow-litigant.21Yad, Sanhedrin XXI, 7. Derived from Sheb. 31a: ‘Whence do we know that a Judge must not hear the claims of one litigant before his fellow-litigant arrives? — For it is said: ‘From a false matter keep far (Ex. XXIII, 7).’ San. 7b: ‘Hear (the causes) between your brethren and judge righteously (Deut. I, 16). Said. R. Ḥanina, This is a warning to the Court of Law not to hear the claims of one litigant before his fellow-litigant arrives (Because in the absence of the other party he will not refrain from stating false pleas).’ However, if the Judge had already heard the claims of one litigant in the absence of the other litigant, it is permissible for him to try the case. But, if after listening to one litigant, he gave the latter a written ruling in accordance with the majority of the Codifiers and Responsa, then he is forbidden to try the case because he is considered an interested party, since he will not contradict his own ruling — ShaK, Tummim. , Zohar wa-Yesheb 179b: ‘Who is regarded as a cunning knave (רשע ערום)? — One who pleaded his cause before the Judge before his fellow-litigant arrived (cf. Sot. 21b), as it written, He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just (the litigant who pleads first states every point in his favour and when he is through it looks as if he is right); but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him out (Prov. XVIII, 17, i.e., the statements of the second party appear false and the Judge searches him out. Hence, both parties should be heard together). This is forbidden even if one litigant states both his cause and that of his adversary — P.Tesh. Zikron Ya‘akob writes that if one litigant presented his case before one whom he knows will act as Judge in his case, i.e., the litigant stated: ‘So-and-so has done me violence,’ — the law is that if the Judge does not investigate into the circumstances surrounding the case under which the violence was committed, he is permitted subsequently to act as Judge. MaHaRIL, however, implies that even pleading in such a form is forbidden (v. D.M.) — P.Tesh. Gloss: And this applies only when the Judge knows that he will act as Judge in the case; but if he had [already] heard the pleas of one party and subsequently the second party was satisfied to be tried before him, he is permitted to act as Judge in the case.22MaHaRIL Resp. 195 — G. This means that the Judge is also aware that the other litigant will have to appear before him, in which case the law is that in the first instance he should not hear the cause of the single litigant for perhaps the second litigant will not be satisfied to be tried before him since the Judge had already heard the pleas of his adversary. Furthermore, when the Judge knows that he will act as Judge, the pleas of the litigant who appeared alone will make an impression upon him, which is not the case, however, where the Judge does not know that he will act as Judge, — then he is permitted to listen to one litigant alone in which case he may try the case only if he tells the second litigant that he had already heard the pleas of the other party, and the second litigant agrees to appear before him, although he heard the pleas of the first litigant — M.E. For this may be equated to a case where one agrees to be tried by a relative of the other party or one who is otherwise unfit to judge — A.H. Moreover, since he was unaware that he would act as Judge in the case, the pleas of the first litigant do not impress themselves upon him — A.H. No Sage should write a decision for one of the litigants in [the following] manner, [viz.,] 'If such [are the circumstances of the case which this litigant set forth before me, then the law would be as follows],'23 Aboth I, 8: ‘Do not make yourself to be like legal advisers (i.e., be careful as Judge not to suggest an advice to one of the litigants).’ or [even] write for him [the litigant] his opinion without [giving] a [definitive] decision as long as he did not hear the words [claims] of both [litigants] lest from his [the Judge's] words they will learn to utter lies,24Aboth I, 9: ‘Simeon b. Shetaḥ would say: Be thorough in the examination of the witnesses and be cautious in your words lest from them (your words) they will learn to utter lies.’ Although this text deals with the interrogation of witnesses, v., however, Bertinora a.l. who refers this both to the witnesses and the litigants. Cf. also ibid. I, 8, Rashi (on the authority of R. Jehudai Gaon) and R. Jonah. [and] furthermore because later the second [litigant] will plead in a different manner and he [the Judge] will [then] be obliged to write the reverse and disrepute will be brought thereby on the Sage.25RaShBA and RIBaSh s. 179 — G. Although the ruling is that ‘we disregard any disrepute that may be brought on the Court’ (v. B.B. 31a; Ket. 26b), and consequently, in the present ruling we should not be concerned with the fact that the Judge on hearing the second litigant will have to alter his judgment and thereby bring contempt on himself, nevertheless, this applies only ex post facto where the Judge is compelled to give a verdict, but not in the present case where he is not obliged to hear the litigants separately. Hence, in the latter case we are afraid of bringing contempt on the Judge. , W.G. and Be’er Eliyahu. However, if the Judge notices that by not giving a decision a wrong might result, e.g., where the inquirer desires to dissolve an engagement or the like, or where dissension might ensue, or where he might save one from being defrauded — then he is obliged to give his decision — A.H. Likewise, is the litigant cautioned against [acting] thus.26San. 7b: ‘R. Kahana stated: This (v. first part of text supra n. 21) can be derived from, Thou shalt not take up (tissa) a false report (Ex. XXIII, 1, תשא) which may (also refer to the litigant) by reading tashshi (תשיא, the Hiph‘il from rt. נשא ‘to deceive’ or ‘to mislead,’ i.e., if one litigant pleads in the absence of his opponent the Judge might be mislead and won over).’ San. ibid.: ‘Hear (the causes) between your brethren and judge righteously (Deut. I, 16). Said R. Ḥanina, this is a warning … to the litigant not to explain his case to the Judge before his adversary appears. Shamo‘a (hear) can also be read shamme‘a (in the Pi‘el which has a causative meaning, i.e., ‘to make hear,’ ‘to explain’).’ In Sheb. 31a this is derived from From a false matter keep far (Ex. XXIII, 7). , also Sot. 21b. Cf. supra n. 21. If it happens that one of the litigants arrives first, he should not sit in the presence of the Judge so as not to be under suspicion — A.H. A scholar who has a case before his teacher should not arrive [at Court] first, [i.e.,] prior to his opponent so that it should not appear that he is [arriving first] in order to clarify his pleas in the absence of his fellow [-litigant]. However, if he has an appointed time to come and study before him and that time had arrived, he is permitted.27Sheb. 30b: ‘Rabbah b. Huna stated: If a scholar and an illiterate person are in dispute with one another, the scholar (and much more so a stranger who is not his student — M.E.) should not arrive first and sit down (before the Judge prior to the arrival of his opponent), because it will appear (i.e., he will be suspected even if he keeps his silence — Rashi) as if he is presenting his case. And we say this only where he has not an appointed time with him (to study); but if he has an appointed time with him, we do not care (i.e., if the Judge is his teacher and they have an appointed time to conduct their studies, then the scholar may come prior to the arrival of his opponent), because he (the opponent) will say, He is occupied with his appointment (for study).’",

Have we not learnt (in the Mishna a.l. ref. to another interpretation of the words, At the mouth of two witnesses [Deut.

However, all the commentators state that the above case refers to witnesses (v. RaN ibid.) , W.G. to § 26, 6 infra where the same applies to the witnesses and in reality it refers to witnesses too, since Mak. ibid. (v. Mishna) speaks of witnesses. The underlying reason for the prohibition against hearing the pleas from the mouth of an interpreter is that when the Judge listens to the claims of the litigants directly, he has first hand information and is in a much better position to clarify the case. If the Judge requires no interpreter even to reply, only that one of the litigants desires to have an interpreter repeat his pleas, it is permissible. So too, if the litigant appointed the interpreter to be his mandatory, it is permissible, for then the interpreter has the status of the litigant. In the case of litigants who speak only a foreign language, it is permissible to have an interpreter, for then it is as though they agreed to be tried under these conditions (כקבלו עליהם) — M.E.

Consequently, it is difficult to understand why Isserles does not cite here the conflicting view. TaZ, however, does not accept the interpretation of M.E., viz., that Asheri and Tur reject this ruling. It is not necessary that the litigant in contradicting his opponent use the phraseology ‘A single … me.’ As long as he contradicts his adversary, it is sufficient — P.Tesh.",

Derived from Sifra to Lev. XIX, 15 (cf. also Ex. XXIII, 3): ‘Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor: (This verse intimates) that you say not, This is a poor man (and) since I and this wealthy person are obliged to support him, I will pronounce judgment in his favour and he will make a decent living (i.e., not be dependent on charity); therefore, it is said, Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor.’ The very same exposition is found in Sifre to Deut. I, 17: ‘Ye shall hear the small and the great alike.’ Nor may [the Judge] favour the person of the mighty, [viz.,] that if there appeared before him a wealthy person or a distinguished scholar with a poor man or an ignorant person [respectively], he should not show him [the wealthy person or scholar] honour,41Nevertheless, the Judge should rise before the scholar (v. supra par. 2 Gloss) — M.E. He should not honour him more than he is legally required. nor should he extend a greeting to him, so that the words of his adversary [the poor or ignorant person] should not become stopped up; nor should he [the Judge] say, 'How can I pronounce him guilty at the trial for he will thus be put to shame, only I will acquit him and subsequently I will say to him that he should give him whatever rightfully belongs to him,' — but [the law is that] he should issue the verdict forthwith in accordance with its truth.42Derived from Sifra ibid. (Nor favour the person of the mighty) and Sifre ibid. If before him appeared one [litigant who] is a worthy person and another [litigant who] is a wicked person, he should not say, 'This one is a wicked person and has the status of making false statements and that one has the status that he does not change [i.e., stands by] his word,43Cf. supra § 15, 1, n. 4.

In other words, their pleas are contradictory. A Judge should not look intently or piercingly at the countenance of a wicked person — ShaK. However, superficial gazing is permissible and psychologically it has the effect of restraining the litigant from making false pleas — P.Tesh. And the [Judge] should adjudicate [the lawsuit] according to that which becomes apparent to him [as a result of] the arguments, and when they leave his presence they should be regarded by him as if they were [both of them] worthy [guiltless] after having accepted the verdict,46Yad, Sanhedrin XXIII,  Derived from Aboth I, 8. and he should judge each one in the scale of merit.47Yad ibid. Derived from Aboth I, 6: ‘And judge all men in the scale of merit.’ Although one of the litigants was refuted, yet, we should endeavour to judge him in the scale of merit because it is quite likely that he had a claim of an outstanding loan (מלוה ישנה) against his fellow-litigant, and consequently, acted thus, on the assumption that the latter would confess (v. infra § 92, 3) — M.E.",

Tam in Tosaf., Ket. 69a s.v. ואישתיק. The reason being that should the Judge remain silent, then one who overhears this boastful statement will be under the impression that this is the law. The threatening statement was made by the litigant as follows: ‘Were I to desire, I would have made such and such a claim and the law would have been in my favour, but now I do not wish to make this claim against you.’ Consequently, if the law is not as stated by the litigant, the Judge is obliged to say to him, ‘You are making a false statement, for the law is not as you state.’ The reason for this requirement is that since the facts mentioned in the litigant’s statement do not enter into the fashioning of the final verdict, one who overhears this will say that the litigant is right since the Judge was silent (Tummim) — P.Tesh. Gloss: A litigant who made a claim against his fellow for a small amount and the Judge sees that according to the law [the defendant] would be liable [to pay] more than the amount which was claimed, the Judge should not give a decision [that the defendant pay] more than that which was claimed, and if he [the Judge] decided for him [the claimant] a larger [amount than he claimed], it is considered an error in judgment and he may retract.51His (Isserles’) own opinion derived from B.B. 5a in the case of Ronya who had a field enclosed on all four sides by fields of Rabina. Thus too, RIBaSh s. 227 — G. The underlying reason for this ruling is that no person will forego his rights without valid grounds, and since the claimant himself did not make this additional claim, apparently he is not entitled to it. Or it is quite possible that the reason the claimant does not make the additional claim is due to the fact that he is aware that the defendant has a counter-claim for the surplus or he may have foregone his claim for some other valid reason. However, if the Judge knows that the claimant is a G-d-fearing person, but is unversed in the law, and this being the reason for his not making a larger claim, since he is afraid that he would be robbing the defendant — the Judge may say to him, Know you that in accordance with the law you are entitled to more, — then if the claimant had foregone his rights or when he owes the defendant the difference, he will state this before the Judge since he is a G-d-fearing person. If the claimant said that he erred in the amount of his claim because he is unversed in the law he is relied upon; or if the Judge himself feels that he has additional rights, he must tell this to the claimant. Otherwise, he must keep his silence, unless the claimant is a G-d-fearing person — A.H. This interpretation removes many objections raised against Isserles’ ruling by M.E., ShaK a.o.",

Derived from San. 30a: ‘(ref. to Mishna ibid. 29a: ‘When the Judges arrived at their verdict they brought them in’) Whom (do they bring in)? Shall we say the litigants: but they are present there already? (In the Mishna ibid. no mention is made that they had to leave)… In reality, the litigants are referred to and this accords with the view of R. Neḥemiah (i.e., during the discussion of the case the litigants were ordered out). For it was taught: R. Neḥemiah stated: This was the custom of the pure-minded in Jerusalem: (first) the litigants were brought in and their pleas were heard; (then) the witnesses were brought in and their statements were heard. Then they were ordered out and the case was then discussed.’ And after they receive their testimony they should order every person out2So that the litigants should not know who declared them guilty or not guilty. Furthermore, so that the litigants should not hear the case discussed by the Judges and learn therefrom to advance false pleas — M.E. However, others who are present there should not be ordered out, especially one who is a distinguished student (תלמיד ותיק) should be permitted to remain. An uncultured disciple should be ordered out (v. supra § 9, 6) — BaḤ and Beth Ya‘akob in Resp. Shebuth Ya‘akob maintains that according to Maim., Tur and Caro everyone should be ordered out in accordance with He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets (Prov. XI, 13) save a disciple of the law unless he is uncultured may remain — P.Tesh. and discuss the case. Some say that it is proper to begin [the discussion with the opinion of] the minor [Judge].3N.Yos. to San. IV, — G. Derived from San. 36a: (ref. to Mishna ibid. 32a: ‘In monetary cases, in cases concerning cleanness and uncleanness [the Judges declare their opinion] beginning with the most distinguished [of the Judges], but in capital cases we begin [with the opinion of] those [that sit] on the side [benches]’): ‘Rab said, I was one of the voters in the school of Rabbi and with me they commenced (It was the law concerning a title to property purchased from the Sikarikon. , Git. 59a. Hence, it deals with a monetary case). But have we not learnt, We begin with the most distinguished (of the Judges)? … The voting in the school of Rabbi was different because in all their voting they began (with the opinion) of those who sit on the side (on account of Rabbi’s humility).’ Hence, when the Mishna states that we begin the voting with the opinion of the most distinguished it means that we may begin with the most distinguished Judge because we do not apprehend that the other Judges will refuse to differ with him; but if they wish to adopt a stringency and begin with the opinion of the minor Judges who sit on the side benches it is a more proper approach, and since this was the procedure adopted in the school of Rabbi, it follows that it is permissible to do so. , also San. ibid.: ‘But in capital cases we begin (with the opinion of those that sit) on the side (benches): Whence do we know this? — R. Aḥa b. Papa stated: Scripture says, Thou shalt not speak al rib (in a case) [Ex. XXIII, 2. Rib רב is taken as rab רב] (i.e.,) you should not speak al rab against the most distinguished (of the Judges).’ This means that it is proper to begin with the side opinion, for if the most distinguished Judge will state his opinion first, the minor Judges will refuse to oppose him and will not have the courage to contradict his opinion. , however, Tosaf. San. ibid., s.v. דיני נפשות; Tosaf. Yom Tob to San. IV, 2. If they unanimously agree, it is good; and if not, they follow the majority.4 Ex. XXIII, 2: To incline after the majority and cf. Mishna San. 2a. We follow the majority even if the third Judge is much greater in learning than the other two Judges who oppose him provided they are informed of his reasoning and yet oppose him (cf. Yeb. 14a in the case of Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel) — A.H. Although the adopted principle is that ‘we do not follow the majority in monetary disputes’ (B.K. 27b) — this refers only to such cases where the minority is existent; but in the present ruling the minority opinion is regarded as non-existent — A.H. In monetary matters we follow a majority of one; in capital cases a majority of two — M.E. , Mishna San. ibid. [If] two say, 'He is not guilty,' and one says, 'He is guilty,' he is not guilty; [if] two say, 'He is guilty,' and one says, 'He is not guilty,' he is guilty; [if] one says, 'He is not guilty,' and one says, 'He is guilty,' and one says, 'I know not [how to decide],' and even if two state, 'He is not guilty,' or 'He is guilty,' while one says, 'I know not [how to decide],'5Mishna San. 29a. We follow the majority only when all the three Judges discuss the matter and state their opinions; but when one Judge states ‘I know not,’ he is regarded as non-existent, for were there in his stead another Judge who would state his opinion, it is quite likely that the other two Judges would concur with him. This however, applies only to the first three Judges who discuss the case; but after the number of Judges is increased, — then even if one Judge says ‘I know not,’ nevertheless, since originally when the Court convened their intention was to reach a verdict through three Judges, we follow the majority — M.E. Beth Ya‘akob in Resp. writes that if two of the three Judges declare him to be not guilty and the opinion of the third is that he is guilty, the latter cannot withhold his opinion in order for them to increase the number of Judges because we apprehend that this will bring contempt on the Court (cf. San. 8a, Tosaf. s.v. מוציא). Shebuth Ya‘akob a.o. reject the ruling of Beth Ya‘akob and hold that it is permissible for the Judge to say ‘I know not.’ Birkath Ya‘akob agrees with Beth Ya‘akob — P.Tesh. they must add6Despite the fact that had he declared his opinion he would still have been overruled by the majority, yet since he says, ‘I know not,’ he is regarded as non-existent, and we require that the case be tried by three Judges — Rashi to Mishna San. 29a, s.v. אפילו. two Judges,7As in capital cases where two Judges are added. , Mishna San. 40a; Tosef. San. VI, 4; Tosef(Z). San. VI, 3 and notes. , Yad, Sanhedrin VIII, 2. and consequently, there are five [Judges] who discuss the case.8San. 17a: ‘You might have thought that the one who states, I know not (how to decide) is regarded as an existing member (of the Court) and that whatever he says should be considered. We are therefore taught that he who states, I know not (how to decide) is considered as non-existent and should he offer a reason (for a certain decision) we do not listen to him.’ Consequently, Caro’s text following Maim. (Yad ibid.) presents a difficulty, since it regards the undecided member as existent (note the words of Caro. ‘consequently, there are five [Judges] who discuss the case)’. For otherwise, after the number of Judges is increased there should be four members. It seems, however, that Maim. and Caro after him maintain that in capital cases only is the undecided member considered as non-existent but not in monetary matters. Cf. San. 33b, Tosaf. s.v. אחד. Lebush writes that to add only one Judge would be insufficient, for it is quite likely that the Judge who was at first undecided might change his mind and agree with the opinion of the added Judge and thus there will be an even number of those who are for acquittal and those who are for conviction — P.Tesh. Cf. also supra § 13, 17, n. 34. Lebush reason is not accepted by some of the Codifiers (v. P.Tesh. and cf. Be’er Eliyahu a.l.) and in reality there are instances where one Judge would make the number uneven, e.g., where they originally commenced the legal proceedings with five Judges and one was found to be ineligible, — then only one Judge should be added. This explains why the number of Judges added in monetary cases is not mentioned in Mishna San. 29a. But in capital cases where the conviction must be effected by a majority of two, it is mentioned (v. San. 40a). If three declare him not guilty and two declare him guilty, he is not guilty; if three declare him guilty and two declare him not guilty, he is guilty; [if] two say, 'He is not guilty,' and two say, 'He is guilty,' while one states, 'I know not [how to decide],' they must add more Judges.9Tosef. San. ibid. e., two more Judges are added. Thus Yad ibid. However, [if] four say, 'He is not guilty,' or 'He is guilty,' while one states, 'I know not [how to decide],' or [if] three stated, 'He is not guilty,' and one says, 'He is guilty,' while one states, 'I know not [how to decide]' — [the law is that] whether he is the [same] one who stated at the beginning, 'I know not [how to decide]' or whether he is another [Judge], we follow the majority.10Likewise if three are for acquittal and two state ‘We know not how to decide,’ we follow the majority. But if two are for acquittal, one for condemnation and two state ‘We know not how to decide,’ the number of Judges must be increased since there is no majority against those who are undecided (RaShaL) — M.E. Caro follows Maim., viz., that after the number of Judges is increased, the one who states, ‘I know not how to decide’ does not invalidate their decision as long as there is a majority of Judges who issue the verdict. Y. San. V, 5 (23a): ‘It was taught: Why are the Judges increased (in civil suits)? — So that if two of the first (Judges) were for acquittal (and one said ‘I know not how to decide’ and they increased the number of the Judges by two) and one of the latter (Judges who were added was also for acquittal and one stated ‘I know not how to decide’), — (the law is that) the proceedings are completed (i.e., sentence is pronounced) by three (since we now have a majority and we do not say that since one stated ‘I do not know’ he is considered as nonexistent and consequently we should again increase the number by two. The point is this: At the outset there were only two Judges who concurred and since the verdict is not valid if given by two Judges, the number had to be increased; but now that there are three who agree, sentence is pronounced and it matters not whether one of the added Judges was for condemnation or was undecided). Said R. La (Heb. לא abbrev. of אילא), Since (two Judges have been added) it seems that the final verdict should be pronounced by four (Judges, because the one who was undecided is regarded as non-existent and now that one of the added Judges is also undecided, he too is regarded as non-existent. Consequently we have only three Judges who declare their opinions and therefore the law is that) we do not conclude the proceedings by three (but we should increase the number again by two more Judges). R. Jose said, You may deduce from this (i.e., from the first opinion recorded here, that we issue the verdict by three), (the law stated in Y. Shebi. X, 4(39c)) — (that) if three (Judges) confirmed (a document) and one of them dies (before they sign it), the two (Judges) sign it and they must write: Although two of us signed it, we judged (confirmed) it by three (For as in our case we do not require that four Judges offer their opinion, so too, in the case of the document we do not have to add another Judge but it suffices that two Judges sign it. Hence, this is in agreement with the First Tanna and not with R. La). Said R. Ḥaggai, the Mishna (too) states this (v. Shebi. X, 4: ‘This is the formula of a Prozbul: I declare before you.....................the Judges, in the place....................., that I shall collect any debt that I may have outstanding with...................., whenever I desire.’ According to Deut. XV, 2 the Sabbatical year cancels a loan and in order to protect the creditor, a declaration was made in Court to the effect, that the law of limitation by the entrance of the Sabbatical year shall not apply to the loan transacted): The Judges sign below or the witnesses (Thus we see that though the declaration was made before a Court of three, nevertheless, it is valid even if two signed the document of Prozbul. Likewise, in the present case where three Judges pronounced the verdict. Hence, we see that this accords with the first opinion contra R. La). But do we apply the rules of Prozbul to ordinary claims? — (Yes), he (R. Ḥaggai) found that it was taught: We apply the rules of Prozbul to ordinary claims.’ It is evident, therefore, that Caro’s opinion recorded in the present ruling, following Yad ibid., accords with the first opinion in Y. contra R. La. Gloss: Thus seems to me to be the fundamental principle, not as he [Caro] writes supra § 13, par. 7 the reverse which is the opinion of those differing with [this view].11 infra par. 4 and notes. Perhaps, however, he [Caro] is of the opinion [that it is necessary] to make a distinction between [a case] where [a Court] was selected at the outset [consisting of] more than three [Judges] and one [where] they went down at the outset [to hold a judicial session consisting of] three [Judges].12Isserles’ words are incomprehensible because RaShBA states explicitly in a Resp. (cited by Kesef Mishneh to San. VIII, 2) that if one member of a Court of three stated, ‘I know not how to decide,’ and then two more Judges were added, and subsequently one of the four Judges said, ‘I know not how to decide,’ — the law is that the verdict is given by the three remaining Judges as if the original judicial session was to be conducted by three Judges, and if two of three declare him guilty or not guilty and one opposes them, we follow the two Judges who represent the majority (v. Y. cited supra n. 10). On the other hand, v. supra § 13, 7, the source of which is also RaShBA which contradicts Resp. The difficulty may be removed by making the following distinction: Here we deal with a case where the original session began with three, in which case RaShBA agrees that the majority is valid; in § 13, 7 we treat of a case where the original session commenced with ten. Hence, all of them must submit their views, and we follow the majority. Cf. San. 5b. As to Isserles’ statement anon that if the community chose four or five arbiters, we do not follow the majority, it should be borne in mind that there is a difference between choice made by a community and that made by litigants — M.E. Yet, [this distinction] does not seem plausible to me; but they [really] differ, — the first [representing] the opinion of Maimonides and the second [representing] the opinion of RaShBA.13Maim. holds that in monetary cases the one who is undecided is considered existent. Consequently, in § 13, 7 supra according to Maim. if one of the ten is undecided, the question may be decided by the majority. However, according to RaShBA who maintains that the undecided Judge is considered non-existent even in monetary cases, in agreement with RaBaD, it follows that since they agreed to be tried by a Court consisting of ten Judges, consequently there are no ten present — Be’er Eliyahu. [In the case of] a community that chose four or five arbiters [to decide a case] we do not follow the majority,14 supra § 12, 18, n. 44. The reason being that since they agree to choose more than three, — the minimum number required for a Beth Din, — their decision must therefore be unanimous, and if there is no unanimous agreement, the defendant is exempt until it can be proven otherwise — M.E. for [the principle of following the] majority applies only in a Court of Law.15Where there is a doubt regarding the meaning of a communal measure (ספק בלשון התקנה) we adopt a leniency with respect to the defendant on the principle that ‘the claimant must produce evidence’ (המוציא מחברו עליו הראיה). Should, however, the defendant be guilty in the eyes of strict law, but on the basis of the doubt regarding the communal measure, he claims that he is exempt, — the law is that he is placed under the jurisdiction of the law and must pay. A Rabbinical measure found in the Talmud is on the same footing as strict law — P.Tesh. Cf. however, supra § 13, 7.

Abbahu stated: When the number of Judges is increased, an evenly-balanced Court of Law may be appointed in the first instance. But is this not self-evident (for this has already been mentioned in the Mishna cited ibid., for when the number of the Judges is increased by two when the twenty-third is undecided, the Court consists of an even number)? — You might have thought that the one who states, I know not (how to decide) is considered as existent and that we should pay attention to what he says. We are therefore informed that the one who says, I know not (how to decide) is considered as non-existent and if he offers a reason (for a particular verdict, i.e., he advances reasons both for acquittal and conviction and on account of this he is in doubt — Thus Rashi), we do not pay attention to him.’ Hence, it follows that since his reasons are not considered should he offer them, consequently, he is not obliged to give reasons for his dubious attitude. Actually, since Maim. and Caro after him hold that in monetary cases the undecided member is considered existent (v. supra n. 8) he should be obliged to offer reasons for his dubious attitude, nevertheless, since in capital cases even if he offers reasons for a particular decision, we do not pay any attention to him, it is proper to conclude that in monetary cases he is not obliged to offer reasons.",

Asheri to San.  , San. 30a (Ref. to Mishna ibid. 29a: ‘If two declare him not guilty etc.’) ‘How is the verdict phrased? — R. Joḥanan said: (The defendant is) not guilty. Resh Lakish said: So-and-so (of the Judges) are for acquittal; So-and-so are for conviction. R. Eleazar said: The defendant has been acquitted by their (the Court’s) verdict. Wherein do they differ? — Whether he shares in making compensation (in the case of an erroneous decision together with the others [v. San. 6a, 33a]). According to the opinion (that the verdict is to be phrased): He (the defendant) is not guilty, he (the dissenting Judge) must pay his share (because without him the other two could not issue a verdict); while according to the opinion (that the verdict should be worded): So-and-so are for acquittal and So-and-so are for conviction, he must not make payment (because his opinion is contained in the verdict). But even according to the opinion (that the verdict should be phrased): He is not guilty, he (the dissenting Judge) might argue, Had you not accepted my viewpoint, you too would not have to share in making compensation! — But they differ regarding their liability to pay his share (in addition to their own). On the view (that the verdict is worded thus): He is not guilty, they pay (the entire) liability (since their view was finally adopted); but according to the view: So-and-so (of the Judges) are for acquittal and So-and-so are for conviction, they do not pay (the share of the dissenting Judge). But even on the view (that the wording should be): He is not guilty, why should they pay (the entire amount)? They could argue (with the third Judge): Had you not been with us, the trial would have had no legal consequences at all!’ This latter statement means that they say to him, ‘You should have withdrawn from the case, having noticed that our opinion is erroneous, and consequently we would not have been able to conclude the trial. Hence, by remaining you too, are to blame and must share in the payment. ShaK writes that we deal here with a case where the Judges are not aware what the outcome of the trial will be. But if they know what the outcome will be, he may withdraw (i.e., even if the withdrawal is not on account of fear that the litigant who will be pronounced guilty is a powerful individual and will persecute the Judge [v. supra § 12, 1], but simply because he has no time to wait until the trial is concluded — P.Tesh.) and the remaining two Judges conclude the case. Nethiboth contends that even the conclusion of the trial (i.e., So-and-so you are guilty etc.) must be made by three Judges. Gloss: Likewise, if at the outset more than three [Judges] were chosen and one [of them] withdrew as has been explained supra § 13 end.22Caro places the law of an undecided Judge and that of one who withdraws from the case on an equal footing, viz., that in both cases the law is not decided by the remaining Judges. Isserles, however, rules (v. supra par. 1) contra Caro (supra § 13, 7) and yet in the present case he agrees with him. It is quite likely that the case of ‘one who withdraws’ is different, for had he been present, he might have advanced a reason for his opinion which would have met with the approval of the other Judges — M.E. Cf. supra n. 12.",

Thus Rashi. cannot upset [the verdict].21San. 31a: ‘A youth (minor) was once summoned to appear for trial before R. Naḥman. Said the latter to him: Have you any witnesses? No, he replied. Have you any (written) evidence? No, he answered. R. Naḥman convicted him. As he walked along weeping, certain people heard him and said to him, We are acquainted with your father’s affairs (and can offer testimony in your favour). Said R. Naḥman: In this case even the Sages (who differ with Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel) agree that the youth is not supposed to know his father’s affairs (and consequently the verdict may be upset).’ From this we infer that in the case of one of age who said, ‘I have no evidence here or in any other locality’ and thereafter produced evidence, he is not believed. When does this apply? — In the case of an adult, but a legatee who was a minor when his legator died and claims were brought against him on account of his legator after he came of age, and he stated, 'I have no witnesses' or 'I have no proof,' and after he left the Court of Law [where he was pronounced] guilty, strangers said to him, 'We are aware of testimony on your father's behalf whereby you may upset this verdict, or a certain individual said to him, 'Your legator deposited this proof [with me],' — [the law is that] he may produce [this evidence] forthwith and it1The Court of Law. Thus Rashi. upsets [the verdict], — for a minor legatee is not [supposed] to know all the [available] proofs of his legator.21San. 31a: ‘A youth (minor) was once summoned to appear for trial before R. Naḥman. Said the latter to him: Have you any witnesses? No, he replied. Have you any (written) evidence? No, he answered. R. Naḥman convicted him.

Gloss: This entire [aforementioned law] applies to an undefined case,22e., where we are unaware whether he knew of the evidence or not. but if the adult subsequently produced proof and witnesses [to prove] that he was unaware of these witnesses [or proofs] which he subsequently produced, or [in the case of] a minor [legatee regarding] whom witnesses came and stated that his father's documents were in his possession and [that] he knew about them when he went to law, — [the law is that] we accept them.23Mord. to San. III end — G. In the former case we upset the verdict though he is of age and the witnesses and proofs were available in his city; in the latter case the verdict stands even though he is a minor.",

    "text_en": "One with whom a formal agreement was made by means of a Kinyan that if he fails to appear [in Court] on a certain date and take an oath, [then] his fellow [-litigant] will be regarded as trustworthy in his pleas and will collect everything that he claims without an oath, or [he stipulates] that if he fails to appear on a certain date and take an oath and [thereby] collect [his claim], he forfeits his rights and will have nothing and his fellow [-litigant] will be exempt1The present ruling is in the order of an anticlimax, for after having stated the law that if one does not fulfil his condition, though a formal agreement was made by means of a Kinyan, the other party has a right to collect his claim, then it applies even more to the following case where if the condition is not fulfilled, the fellow-litigant is exempt. Or it is quite likely that both these rulings have to be mentioned because in the former case a Kinyan has to be effected at an authoritative Court of Law, but not in the latter case — M.E. [from making payment], — and [then] the [stipulated Court] day passed and he failed to appear, — [the law is that] the conditions become effective2Yad, Sanhedrin VII, 10 and Tur. Thus also SeMaG on the authority of the Geonim. , also Hag. Maim. to Yad ibid. Derived from Y.Kid. III, 2(63d): (Ref. to Mishna ibid. regarding one who betrothed a woman on a condition): ‘If he met with an unavoidable interference (and could not fulfil his condition of betrothal), — R. Joḥanan stated, (With respect to) an unavoidable interference it is as though he did not act (and consequently in the case of betrothal a plea of unavoidable interference is invalid contra divorce where such a plea would be accepted, the reason being that in the case of divorce the matter depends wholly on the husband’s consent; whereas in betrothal her consent is also required. Thus Korban ‘Edah). R. Simeon b. Lakish stated, (With respect to) an unavoidable interference it is as though he acted (and therefore the plea of ‘unavoidable interference’ is applicable to betrothal as well as divorce. Thus Korban ‘Edah).’ The Halachah rests with R. Joḥanan. But as we have seen from the above text of Y., according to R. Joḥanan a plea of ‘unavoidable interference’ is invalid. Hence, it would follow that in our present ruling he should not be free from the obligation effected by the Kinyan even if he was unavoidably prevented to appear. BaḤ, therefore, suggests that the text of Y. should be emended thus: Instead of ‘R. Joḥanan stated … it is as though he did not act’ (לא עבד), we should read ‘it is as though he did not violate (the condition)’ (לא עבר). , Be’er Eliyahu who does not consider this emendation as plausible and maintains that the source of this ruling is Ned. 27b q.v. anon The following sources should be examined in order to clarify the present ruling: Tosef. B.M. I, 9: ‘If both parties to a lawsuit are stubborn, and one said to the other, If I will not appear (for trial) between now and a certain date, (then) such and such an amount which is in my possession will become yours, — (the law is that) if the time is up (and he did not appear), the condition must be fulfilled. Thus R. Jose. Said R. Judah, How can he take possession of aught that is not his, but he must seize it.’ The same controversy is found in B.B. 168a: Mishna: ‘If a man paid part of his debt and the bond was placed with a third party to whom (the debtor said), If I have not paid you (the balance) by such a date, then give him (the creditor) his bond, (and) the date arrived and he did not pay, R. Jose says, He (the trustee) should give it (to him); R. Judah says, He should not give it (to him).’ Gemara: ‘On what principle does their difference of opinion rest? — R. Jose holds that Asmakta (v. supra § 12, nn. 45-46) gives one a valid title; whereas R. Judah maintains that Asmakta gives no title. R. Naḥman on the authority of Rabbah b. Abbahu on the authority of Rab Said: The law rests with R. Jose. When (cases of Asmakta) came before R. Ammi, he stated: Since R. Joḥanan has taught us time and again that the law follows R. Jose, what can I do? The law, however, does not rest with R. Jose.’ , Tosaf. s.v. אמר רב נחמן. Ned. 27b: ‘The law is that Asmakta gives one a legal title, provided he did not meet with an unavoidable interference, and a formal agreement by Kinyan was effected at an authoritative Court of Law (an ordained Beth Din. Thus Rashi and Maim. RaN: A Beth Din that has the authority to enforce its decisions).’ , also infra § 55,  and he forfeits his rights3This refers to both cases — M.E. , supra n.  forthwith4Ned. 27b: ‘A man once deposited his rights at the Court of Law, and stated: If I do not appear within thirty days, these rights will be void. Subsequently he was prevented from appearing by an unavoidable interference. R. Huna ruled: His rights are void.’ This means forthwith. Cf. also B.B. ibid. — RaShBaM. Cf. supra n. 1 on the final law regarding an unavoidable interference. and they do not grant him an extension of time.5B.Yos. to § 19 on the authority of RaShBA — G. e., if he requests an extension of time to take his oath, we do not grant him this. However, if he demands an extension of time to make payment, his request is granted (v. infra § 100) — ShaK. However, if he produced proof that he was unavoidably prevented [to appear] on that date,6If he was unavoidably prevented from fulfilling his condition only on the last day, v. Y.D. § 232, 12, Gloss where two opinions are mentioned concerning this type of unavoidable interference. According to Yad ibid. even if he was unavoidably prevented on the last day only, it is considered valid. He must also clarify the unavoidable interference, but if he has no proof, then even if he is the possessor, it is considered possession in error, and he cannot put forward the plea of ‘the claimant must produce evidence’ (המוציא מחברו עליו הראיה) — Tummim. he is free from [the obligation] of this formal agreement by Kinyan7And it is as though no formal agreement by means of Kinyan was ever effected. And even though he is no longer unavoidably prevented and did not appear forthwith, he may take his oath whenever he so desires — Tummim. and he may [subsequently] take an oath when his fellow [-litigant] summons him again8Whether to take an oath and collect or to take an oath and be exempt — ShaK contra M.E. as in the first instance. And thus too, everything that is similar to this [case]. And this entire [ruling is applicable only] where a formal agreement was made with him by means of a Kinyan,9e., at an authoritative Court of Law. However, it is not necessary for him to deposit his rights embodied in a document with the Court. BaḤ holds that the Kinyan need not be effected before an authoritative Court. M.E., ShaK a.o. differ with BaḤ. , Caro (in B.Yos. infra § 207) that both the formal Kinyan and the depositing of his rights must be made at an authoritative Beth Din. but not otherwise, for [then] this would be a mere Asmakta.10Mord. to San. beg. and RaShBA Resp. s. 899; v. infra § 207 — G.",

    "text_en": "One [of the litigants] who accepted a relative1Yad, Sanhedrin VII, 2. Derived from Mishna San. 24a: ‘If one (of the litigants) said to the other, I accept my father as trustworthy,’ or ‘I accept your father as trustworthy,’ or ‘I accept three oxherds as trustworthy.’ R. Meir says, He may (subsequently) retract; but the Sages maintain, He cannot retract.’ By stating ‘father’ we derive that accepting a relative is valid. or an [otherwise] ineligible person2Mishna ibid.: ‘I accept three oxherds as trustworthy,’ whence we derive the law of accepting an ineligible person. For an oxherd is ineligible to judge or to testify — v. San. 25b: ‘Raba stated: The oxherds to whom (the Sages) have made reference include the oxherds of both large and small cattle.’ Therefore, we are informed that if they were accepted by the litigants, it is valid. , also ibid. 24b: ‘Raba stated: If one accepted a relative or an (otherwise) ineligible person (to act as Judge or witness), he may retract before the conclusion of the trial, but not afterwards.’ Gemara concludes that Raba’s statement agrees with R. Joḥanan according to the view of the Sages in the Mishna. to act as a Judge3San. 25b: ‘For we learnt: (If one says), I accept three oxherds as trustworthy (they are acceptable [which means that otherwise they are ineligible]). Does this not (mean that ordinarily they are ineligible) for witnesses? — No, for Judges. This is also apparent from the expression three oxherds; for if it means eligible as witnesses, why three?’ Hence, if they were accepted, it is valid and according to the Sages, he may not retract. or a witness4San. 23b whence it is derived that acceptance of an otherwise ineligible person to act as witness is on the same par as accepting him to judge. The entire Mishna in San. 24a deals with a case where the acceptance took place before a Court of three eligible Judges (v. Y. San. III, 5(21a)). For if outside of the Court and there was no formal agreement made by Kinyan, the law is that even after the conclusion of the trial, he may retract according to all the authorities — Hag. Asheri on the authority of O.Z. N.Yos. and R. Yeruḥam (to B.B. VIII) on the other hand, maintain that the relatives or otherwise ineligible persons were not accepted before a Court; but if their acceptance was before a Court, then even before the conclusion of the trial, he may not retract — ShaK. Tummim writes that actually there is no difference whether they were accepted before a Court of Law or not. For once the pleas are presented before them they enjoy the status of a Court and it is regarded as if the acceptance took place before a Court of Law. The acceptance of a relative is valid only where the litigant knew that this was his relative, but if he pleads that he was unaware that he was his relative, the law is that he must take an equitable oath (v. supra § 1, n. 2) and may retract (BaḤ). However, if the litigant used to visit him and now he states that he was unaware that he is his relative, he is not regarded trustworthy (v. infra § 36, 2). Where the litigant claims that he was unaware that the accepted person was ineligible, the following distinction should be borne in mind: If the person is Rabbinically ineligible, in which case a public announcement is usually made in Court proclaiming him as such — then the litigant is not believed (v. ShaK infra § 71, n. 31) because all judicial matters are publicized; whereas in the case of an ineligible person who does not require a public announcement proclaiming him as such — the litigant is regarded trustworthy — P.Tesh. If the relative reveals that he is obliged to help and support the litigant, the latter’s acceptance of him is invalid (Keneseth ha-Gedolah). Shebuth Ya‘akob reports a case concerning a woman who left instructions prior to her death that if any dissension will arise between her sons, a certain relative of hers should adjudicate their case, and the sons obligated themselves by means of ‘striking hands’ (תקיעת כף) to follow the decision of that relative, and now one of the sons refuses to be tried before him, claiming a) that the latter is an illiterate person who is incompetent to adjudicate such matters, or at least others should be co-opted forming a Beth Din; b) that this person is more favourably disposed to one of the other brothers. Resp.: The law is that regarding the Talmudic principle ‘It is a religious duty to carry out the instructions of a dying person’ (Ket. 68b-70a; Git. 14b, 15a, 40a), it would not be applicable in this case (v. infra § 252, 2; Y.D. § 232, 17, Gloss); but as far as the obligation effected through ‘striking hands,’ the instructions must be carried out, and as to a) he knew about this at the outset and yet accepted him; b) every vow, the release of which, brings in its wake the ‘least suspicion of sin’ (נדנוד עבירה), should not be annulled (v. Y.D. § 230, Gloss). Hence, in the present case there is still a ‘suspicion of sin’ against his mother because he should carry out the instructions of his mother, albeit in the category of ‘fulfilling his duty beyond the requirements of the law,’ although strictly speaking this is not applicable in the present case — P.Tesh. — Gloss: the acceptance is regarded [valid] only when [the litigant] accepted him to act as Judge; but if he deposited money with him regarding which they were in dispute, it is not designated [valid] acceptance5RIBaSh s. 311 — G. This refers to a case where one took an oath to pay his fellow on a certain date, and when the time for payment arrived, he deposited the money with the town Judge in order to fulfil his obligation effected through the oath, and instructed the Judge not to deliver the money to the other party because he had a claim against him and the Judge was related to him. Consequently, since the litigant did not accept the Judge explicitly, the acceptance is not valid and the judgment has no legal consequences — M.E. — even if he accepted one of those ineligible on account of sin as [equivalent to] two eligible witnesses to testify on his behalf or [he accepted him] as three of a Court of Law [of] authoritative [Judges] to adjudicate [the case] for him.6Yad, Sanhedrin VII, 2. Derived from San. 24a (ref. to Mishna ibid.): ‘R. Dimi b. R. Naḥman b. R. Joseph stated: (The Mishna has reference to a case) e.g., where he (the litigant) accepted him (i.e., one of those mentioned) as one (of the three Judges).’ According to Rashi this refers to R. Meir’s viewpoint and it means that even if there are two other eligible Judges, R. Meir maintains that he may retract, whence it follows that according to the Sages, both if he accepted him as one of the Judges or as three, he cannot retract. ‘An ineligible person’ is mentioned here in order to introduce a remarkable feature, viz., that even one who is disqualified to offer testimony in any other case. Much more so in the case of a ‘father,’ who is eligible to offer testimony in other cases, is the acceptance considered valid where the latter was accepted as two witnesses or three Judges — M.E. Gloss:7This Gloss should come after ‘he can … legal proceedings are closed’ anon — M.E. Some differ [with this ruling] and are of the opinion that [this is applicable] only if he accepted a relative or an [otherwise] ineligible person as one Judge or as one witness; but if he accepted him as two [witnesses or as three authoritative Judges] in which case there are two irregularities — [the law is that] even after the legal proceedings are closed, he may retract.8Thus Alfasi to San. III contra Gaon who maintains that even if a formal Kinyan was made before a Beth Din, he may retract, since it was a Kinyan made in error. Cf. Sheb. 42a: ‘A certain (man) said to his fellow: You are believed by me like two whenever you claim that I have not paid you. He went and paid him before three. Said R. Papa: He believed him like two but like three he did not believe him. To this R. Huna b. R. Joshua objected: Two are like a hundred and a hundred are like two! But if he said to him: Like three, and he went and paid him before four (witnesses, the lender is not believed), for since he cares to mention a certain number of opinions (that he believes him like three people) he means (exclusively) that number of opinions (for otherwise he would have mentioned only two who are equivalent to any number).’ There must have been a formal Kinyan made, for if the statement of credence was made at the time the loan was transacted it is equivalent to Kinyan; otherwise formal Kinyan is required. We thus see that as far as two are concerned the lender is believed according to all opinions, although there were two irregularities (תרתי לריעותא), a) he believed the lender himself; b) he considered him as two witnesses. Likewise in the present ruling there are two irregularities, a) one Judge was accepted like three; b) even he was Biblically ineligible. Hence even in the case of two irregularities, once a Kinyan was made he may not retract on the principle ‘nothing else is required after Kinyan is effected’ (אין לאחר קנין כלום). Should he, however, appoint another Court to deal with the case, the latter must adjudicate the case in accordance with the pleas and admissions presented before the first Court (provided there was a formal Kinyan made. Thus Nethiboth) — M.E. on the authority of RaShBA Resp. If he accepted one eligible Judge like three experts (Mumḥin) or one eligible witness like two and the trial was concluded he may not retract (since there is only one irregularity) — M.E. and later authorities contra ShaK. , P.Tesh. Likewise, if he accepted three ineligible persons (simultaneously. , P.Tesh) like three eligible ones, he may not retract, since there is only one irregularity — Tummim. , however, K.H. Thus is the common consent of the majority of the Codifiers.9In accord with San. 23b, Tosaf. s.v. ואמר who point out that R. Dimi’s statement (v. supra n. 6) refers to the view held by the Sages, viz., that he may not retract; but if he accepted one as the equivalent of a complete Court, even the Sages will agree that he may subsequently retract on account of two irregularities involved. ShaK, however, cites many authorities who accept the first opinion. However, if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a Kinyan, in nowise may he retract.10e., even if they accepted one witness as two — M.E. Thus Alfasi. Derived from Sheb. 42a. , supra n. 8. Whether he accepted to forfeit his rights and to remit whatever he claimed in accordance with their verdict or he accepted to pay whatever claim his fellow [-litigant] will make against him according to the evidence of this ineligible person or according to his legal decision11San. 24b: ‘R. Naḥman b. R. Ḥisda sent a query to R. Naḥman b. Jacob: Will our Master kindly teach us, Is the difference of opinion (between R. Meir and the Sages) before or after the verdict (is given), and with whom does the law accord? — He sent back word: The difference of opinion has reference to the close of legal proceedings (i.e., after the verdict is given) and the law rests with the Sages. R. Ashi stated: This was the query he sent: Do they differ in a case where (the defendant says) I will pay your claim, (if such is the verdict), or with regards to (a case where the plaintiff says) Let my claim against you be remitted (should this be the final verdict. The point is this: In the former case money will be transferred from one party to another, and consequently more power must be exercised; in the latter case, less authority is required, since the possessor has a presumption of ownership) and with whom does the law accord? — He replied: The controversy is with reference to I will pay you and the law accords with the Sages.’ — [the law is that] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a Kinyan relative to this [matter], he cannot retract; but if they did not make a formal agreement with him by means of a Kinyan, he can retract before the legal proceedings are closed.12San. 24b: ‘A message was dispatched from the School of Rab to Samuel as follows: Will our Master kindly teach us, (If one of the parties) made a formal agreement by Kinyan (not to retract), what (if he desires to retract) before the verdict is given? — He sent back word: After a formal agreement is made by means of Kinyan, nothing (can be done to retract from the pledge).’ Although this (i.e., not to retract) appears to be ‘a mere verbal agreement’ (קנין דברים), i.e., that of which ownership is acquired by means of the Kinyan is only a verbal promise, and does not involve any concrete article, — yet, we do find that the Kinyan binds him in his undertaking (v. B.M. 67b; B.B. 3a; supra § 12, n. 31). Thus N.Yos. RaBaN maintains that the Kinyan is binding only when the litigant pledges himself to follow the verdict of the Court or to accept the evidence of the witnesses — ShaK. Supra § 12, 2 it has been explained what is considered the close of legal proceedings.13e., when the pronouncement is made: ‘So-and-so, you are guilty’ or ‘So-and-so, you are not guilty,’ and much more so when they say to him ‘Go and pay him’ which indicates that a definitive decision has been reached. Not so, however, when they say to him, ‘You are obliged to pay him,’ for such a statement is indicative that they are still in doubt — M.E. ShaK adds that the legal proceedings are also considered closed when the litigants leave Court. And as to the matter of evidence, — [the law is that] as soon as [the witnesses] have testified, he cannot retract.14RIBaSh s. 490 and Mord. — G. Thus also majority of Codifiers. , Sheb. 30b. [As soon as] the legal proceedings are closed, he cannot retract15San. 24b. , supra n. 1 Yad, Sanhedrin VII, 2 has ‘Once the legal proceedings are closed and money was exacted through the verdict of this ineligible person or through his testimony, he may not retract.’ Kes. Mishneh explains that it does not necessarily mean that money had been exacted, but that since the legal proceedings are closed it is as though money had been exacted. The litigants are not permitted to retract even if they both agree, the reason being that out of deference to the Judge, the verdict must stand unless the litigants wish to make a complete remission to each other — B.Yos. provided it did not become known that [the Judges] erred [in their decision].16San. 6a: ‘R. Abbahu stated: All concur that a decision given by two (Judges) in civil cases is not valid. R. Abba raised an objection (from the following): If one adjudicated a case by himself and pronounced the guilty, not guilty, and the not guilty, guilty, or the unclean, clean, his act cannot be upset, but he (the Judge) has to pay from his own pocket (This clearly shows that the decision of one Judge also stands)? — We deal here with a case where the litigants accepted the Judge. If so, why should the Judge) pay indemnity? — Because they (the litigants) said to him: Adjudicate the case for us in accordance with the law of the Torah.’ The Talmud (ibid.) concludes that if the Judge erred in his decision by overlooking a law stated in the Mishna, he may revoke his decision; but if he made a mistake in deciding against common pratice, his act cannot be undone and he must pay from his own pocket. It is thus evident that whenever the litigants accept the Judge, even if he is ineligible, then even if a Kinyan was effected, it is only on condition that no error should be made. Otherwise they may retract. Cf. Git. 14a: ‘R. Naḥman said, If a formal agreement by means of Kinyan was effected in error, the money must be returned.’ In a case where the Judges erred in their decision and the litigant is then permitted to retract, he is allowed to present his case anew and even alter his original pleas. Furthermore, the second Court of Law gives the litigant a new extension of time to produce his proofs or other required evidence. If the litigants accepted the Judges to adjudicate their case in accordance with strict law, and they (the Judges) made a settlement through arbitration, this too, is considered an error in judgment and even if the litigants bound themselves by a Kinyan, they may retract — M.E., ShaK. However, if they are [the] duly appointed [Judges] in the city or the representatives of the town, he cannot retract,17For in such a case it was known that the Judges are incompetent, and consequently, when they were accepted by the litigants, it meant that their decision would be followed even if it were erroneous since they are the representatives of the town. , infra § 25. In this case even if the litigants accepted them to Judge in accordance with the law of the Torah and the latter instead made a settlement by arbitration, their decision is still binding — M.E. If the Judges were accepted before the representatives of the town (even three of the representatives. Not necessarily the entire seven) even Kinyan is not required (v. infra § 163 end) — M.E., ShaK. Hence, even before the conclusion of the trial, one may not retract. Not so, however, if the acceptance took place before three Judges who are not the town representatives. In this case one may retract only before the conclusion of the trial — ShaK. for thus is the adopted practice [viz.,] that whatever a person accepts before the heads of the town, he cannot retract.18Tesh. Maim. to Shofetim end — G. If [the litigant] denies [this] and states, 'I did not accept [him] to act as Judge,' and there are no witnesses [to confirm this] statement, he must take an oath that he did not accept him [as Judge] even if the Judge contradicts him and stated that he [the litigant] did accept him.19Tur and Asheri in Resp. e., he takes an equitable oath (שבועת היסת), because the Judge is not regarded as a witness in order to obligate the litigant to take a Biblical oath (שבועה דאורייתא) for the following reasons: a) Since we deal here with a relative or one otherwise ineligible; b) The litigant does not deny any monetary claim save that he did not accept him as Judge in which case a Biblical oath is not imposed — M.E. ShaK (followed by W.G.) rejects the latter reason and maintains that this is certainly regarded as a denial of a monetary claim. Hence, where the Judge is eligible, the litigant would have to take a Biblical oath. Nethiboth writes that we consider the litigant’s statement a denial of a monetary claim only after he was pronounced guilty by the Judge; but if he was not yet pronounced guilty save that the Judge claims that the litigant accepted him by means of a Kinyan to act as Judge, it is not considered a denial of a monetary claim. If two of the Judges are eligible persons all agree that they are believed when they state that they were accepted as Judges. [In the case of] a public that has recognized unlearned Judges as authorities over them, the litigants cannot prevent [them from trying their case].20R.

    "text_en": "One who was under obligation to his fellow to take an oath in Court and [the latter] said, 'Swear to me by the life of your head and be exempt,' or 'Swear to me by the life of your head and I will pay you whatever you claim,'24Yad, Sanhedrin VII,  Derived from Mishna San. 24a: ‘If a man was under obligation to take an oath before his fellow, and the latter said to him, Vow to me by the life of your head (which is not the formula of a legal oath since ‘swearing’ and the ‘Divine Name’ are not included), R. Meir says, He may retract; but the Sages say, He cannot retract.’ The law here is on the same footing as supra par. 1 in the case of a relative or otherwise ineligible person. , notes ibid. which are also applicable in the present case. , B.B. 127b-128a: ‘R. Abba sent to R. Joseph b. Ḥama: If one says to his fellow, You stole my slave, and the other replies, I did not steal (him), (and when the former asks further), On what grounds did he (come) into your possession, (the latter replies), You sold him to me, you gave him to me as a gift, (but) if you wish, Take an oath (that he was neither sold nor presented) and you will get him back (although legally the possessor cannot be compelled to accept the oath of the plaintiff), and (the plaintiff) took the oath, (then the latter) is not permitted to retract. What does he inform us? We have already learnt (this elsewhere. Cf. Mishna and Gemara San. 24a): If one (of the litigants) said to the other party, I accept my father as trustworthy or I accept your father as trustworthy, or I accept three oxherds as trustworthy, R. Meir says, He may (subsequently) retract; but the Sages say, He may not retract! — (R. Abba) teaches us this: That the controversy (between R. Meir and the Sages) is where (a litigant stated), I will pay you, and the law accords with the Sages (v. supra n. 11).’ We thus see that the case of accepting an oath which legally is not binding is equated to the case of accepting a relative or an otherwise ineligible person to act as Judge. In both cases the law is that after the close of legal proceedings, even in a case of ‘I will pay you’ and before the close of legal proceedings where an agreement was made by Kinyan, one may not retract. — [then] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a Kinyan, he cannot retract; and if they did not make a formal agreement with him by means of a Kinyan, he can retract until the legal proceedings are closed.25, supra n. 12. Once the legal proceedings are closed and he took the oath26In the case where an oath is taken the proceedings are considered closed after the oath is taken. Note the expression ‘Once the legal proceedings are closed and he took the oath.’ According to Rashi and Asheri the proceedings are likewise considered closed when the litigant leaves the Court. , Isserles anon — M.E. , B.B. 128a, Tosaf. s.v. הכי גרסינן ונשבע; Sheb. 39a, Tosaf. s.v. אם; San. 24b, Tosaf. s.v. שלח. Other Codifiers read נשבע i.e., even if he had not yet taken the oath, as long as the trial was concluded, he may not retract — ShaK. , Gloss infra and notes. as stated to him [by his fellow-litigant], he cannot retract and is obliged to make payment. Likewise one who was under obligation to take an equitable oath27, supra § 1, n. 2. and transferred it [the oath] to his opponent,28This excludes a Biblical oath (שבועה דאורייתא) which is not transferred (v. infra § 87) — M.E. In B.B. ibid. (v. supra n. 24) even if there were a single witness to substantiate the plaintiff’s claim, no Biblical oath would be imposed in a claim that concerns slaves (v. Sheb. VI, 5) save that an equitable oath (שבועת היסת) would have to be taken; but since in the latter case where the possessor makes a complete denial and there is not even a single witness to contradict him, the latter would have to take an equitable oath only, consequently, he may transfer the oath to the plaintiff. — [then] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a Kinyan or if the party to whom it was transferred took the oath, he cannot retract. So too, one who was not obliged to take an oath and stated, 'I will take an oath,' — [then] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a Kinyan, he cannot retract; and if they did not make a formal agreement with him by means of a Kinyan, although he accepted in [the presence of] the Court [to take the oath], he may retract until the legal proceedings are closed and [only thereafter] he must take the oath. Gloss: One who is under obligation to take an oath and stated before the Court of Law, 'I desire not to take an oath, I am prepared to make payment,' and [then] left the Court of Law, — [the law is that] he cannot retract for this is regarded the close of his legal proceedings.29Sheb. 39a: ‘If he stated, I shall not take an oath (realizing the seriousness of swearing falsely), he is dismissed (from Court) forthwith (so as not to give him a chance to change his mind, and he pays the claim. Thus Rashi). According to Tosaf. (v. sources supra n. 26) the question whether we consider the legal proceedings closed after the litigant makes his statement before the Court and then leaves or whether the oath must be taken before the litigant leaves the Court, is applicable both in the case where one was under obligation to take an oath and stated ‘I desire not to take an oath etc.,’ or where the defendant transfers the oath to the claimant, or where one states ‘Vow by the life of your head.’ According to those authorities who maintain that if he said ‘I desire not to take an oath etc.,’ and then left Court, he may not retract, the same principle applies equally in the other cases. Those who differ with this opinion and hold that in the case of one under obligation to take an oath, the legal proceedings are considered closed only after the oath is taken, the same principle is also applicable in the other cases. Consequently, Isserles Gloss presents a difficulty. For according to the present Gloss, the difference of opinion between the above-mentioned authorities is only with respect to one who states ‘I will not swear,’ but not regarding the other cases (v. M.E., ShaK and W.G.). This difficulty may be removed if we bear in mind that the law of one who was under obligation to take an oath and stated ‘I desire not … he cannot retract etc.,’ was stated only in accordance with Rashi’s interpretation followed by Asheri (v. supra n. 29). One who was under obligation to take an equitable oath in Court and did not state that he wishes to transfer the oath to his adversary and then left Court and subsequently stated that he desires to transfer the oath, is permitted to do so — Tur. Even if he stated ‘I will not swear’ and then left Court, he may subsequently transfer the oath, because we assume that what he meant is this: ‘I will not swear but I will transfer the oath,’ provided he did not say, ‘I will not swear but I will make payment’ — M.E. If the defendant was under obligation to take an equitable oath and he stated in Court ‘I will swear’ and before taking the oath, he left, the law is that he subsequently cannot transfer the oath — M.E. ShaK rejects the latter ruling of M.E. For only where he stated ‘I will not swear but I will make payment’ he may not retract if he left the Court, because as soon as he says ‘I will not swear etc.,’ it is regarded as an admission of guilt; but where he stated ‘I will swear’ it is as though he said ‘I am prepared to carry out the verdict,’ but it does not mean that he actually accepted to take the oath. Hence, he may subsequently transfer the oath. And this is the adopted custom in many Holy communities (v. P.Tesh conflicting views regarding this custom). This holds good only with respect to an equitable oath, but in the case of a Biblical oath where legally one may not transfer it (v. infra § 87; Sheb. 41a), if one said to his fellow ‘Swear and collect’ and the latter stated ‘I will swear’ and then left the Court or even where he did not leave the Court but the Judges had already commenced the discussion of another case, he may not retract — Nethiboth. Some [authorities], however, differ [with this view].30, Tur — G. Cf. previous note. One who was under obligation to his fellow to take a Biblical oath and he said to the latter, 'Take an oath and collect,' and [then the latter hurriedly] took an oath without holding a [sacred] object, — [the law is that] he [the defendant] cannot retract.31And say ‘I will swear and be exempt,’ but the plaintiff must take another oath while holding a sacred object. Other authoorities differ with this view and maintain that since he took the oath without holding a sacred object (e.g., a Scroll of the Law or Phylacteries) we do not consider the legal proceedings as closed and consequently, he may retract unless the litigants left the Court or the Judges commenced the discussion of another case — ShaK. However, according to the former view, even if he took the oath outside of the Court, it is still regarded as the close of legal proceedings — A.H.",

    "text_en": "As long as the litigants are [still] standing before the Judge, he is believed when he states, 'I have pronounced this party guilty' and 'I have pronounced that party not guilty.' [As soon as] they are dismissed from his presence, he is not believed.1Kid. 74a: ‘A Judge is believed when he states, I have pronounced this one not guilty; I have pronounced that one guilty. When does this apply? Only if the litigants are (still) standing before him; but if they no longer stand before him, he is not believed. But let us see who holds (the document containing) the verdict in favour (since they gave a written verdict to each litigant)? — It refers to a case where the written document was torn. Then let us give them a re-trial? — (It refers to a case of) discretionary judgment (i.e., the Judge based his verdict on discretion and could not decide on the basis of any law. In this case we cannot be certain that a re-trial will result in the same decision).’ , Ket. 85b. An arbitrator is likewise not believed when he states that the settlement was according to such and such terms if the litigants are no longer before him (RaShBA) — M.E. , Isserles anon. This is based on the following case cited by B.Yos. supra § 12: A gave B a gift of bonds and took an oath that he will not collect any of the debts covered by the bonds. Subsequently A and B were in dispute concerning other claims and they accepted an arbitrator on condition that whatever settlement he reaches within a certain time limit should be effective and the latter arbitrated the case and ruled that A and B should remit their claims by means of a written document excluding the case of the bonds that A had made a gift to B which are to remain in effect as of the day of arbitration and later it was discovered that A had collected money on the strength of the bonds given to B and the latter contends that the money collected by A should be returned, to which A responds that since he collected the money prior to the date on which the document of remittal became effective, notwithstanding the fact that he presented the bonds to B on condition that they remain in their original force, he should be exempt from returning the collected money especially since it states in the document of remittal drawn up by the arbitrator that the settlement excludes the bonds as of the date of arbitration. The arbitrator was consulted and he agreed with A. Responsum: The law accords with B’s claim because when the other claims between A and B were submitted to the arbitrator, it was unknown that A had collected money on the strength of the bonds, for it was presumed that the bonds were intact since A took an oath to this effect. Consequently this did not enter into the remittal. And as to the statement of the arbitrator, he is not believed because he did not make this declaration when the litigants were still before him as in the present ruling with regards to a Judge. Nethiboth writes that the Judge is believed as long as the litigants still stand before him even if the one who was pronounced guilty could employ the principle of Miggo (i.e., since the the litigant could have stated ‘I did not accept you as Judge’), because since the Judge is believed as two witnesses, it would be tantamount to a Miggo in face of witnesses which is not effective. If the litigant contends that the Judge had pronounced judgment in his favour but the Judge and the other litigant state that the verdict had not yet been given, the Judge is believed even where the litigants are no longer before him provided that there are witnesses who testify that the litigants accepted him as Judge; but if there are no witnesses available and the litigants are no longer before the Judge, the claim of the litigant is accepted on the principle of Miggo, viz., that they did not accept him as Judge. And in this case the principle of Miggo in the face of witnesses (i.e., if we accept the statement of the Judge as equivalent to the testimony of two witnesses) is not accepted since the litigants are no longer before the Judge, in which case the latter is not regarded as equivalent to two witnesses — Nethiboth. However, the Judge is believed as one witness, provided he is not a relative or an otherwise ineligible person, and hence places the litigant who contradicts him under an oath and exempts the one who supports his statement from taking an oath. If the Judge died or left and the litigants contradict each other, each one stating that judgment was pronounced in his favour, — the law is that if one is the possessor (מוחזק) of the disputed article, the onus rests on the other party to produce evidence in order to substantiate his claim; if both are possessors, they divide the disputed article; if both are not possessors, the stronger of the two obtains possession or they make a settlement — M.E. And [this refers to a case] where the written verdict is not in his [the litigant's] possession,2Kid. ibid. , previous note beg. This means that if the litigant has the judgment writ, the Judge is believed even if they are no longer standing before him. Accordingly, the question in the Gemara ibid., ‘Let us see who holds (the document containing) the verdict in favour’ refers to the latter part of the cited Baraitha (i.e., ‘but if they no longer stand before him, he is not believed’). RITBA, however, refers this question to the first part of the Baraitha (i.e., ‘the Judge is believed only if the litigants are still standing before him’). In other words, why rely on the Judge if we can see the judgment writ. For if it refers to the latter part of the Baraitha, the following difficulty arises: If we do not believe the Judge, why accept the judgment writ? — ShaK. Where the judgment writ held by A contains an undefined statement, e.g., ‘The land of So-and-so belongs to you,’ and B claims that the judgment writ was in his possession but he lost it, then the Judge is believed when he says, ‘I ruled in favour of this party’ — ShaK. and [this ruling is applicable] only to a case of discretionary judgment;3Kid. ibid. , supra n.  According to R. Tam (Kid. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. שודא a.e.) discretionary judgment means favouring or making a gift to any one of the litigants. Rashi: The Judges use their discretion in order to determine which of the claimants is to be believed. However, even if the litigants accepted the Judge to give a verdict based on discretionary judgment, it is still doubtful whether a re-trial would result in the same verdict — ShaK, Nethiboth. but in [the case of] a verdict which depends upon the pleas [of the litigants], reliance [on the Judge] does not apply, for in accordance with [the restatement of] the pleas the one who deserves favourable judgment will be so pronounced4And even while the litigants are still before the Judge, the latter is not believed, but he must clarify the matter by stating, ‘So-and-so, you have pleaded thus and So-and-so, you have pleaded thus and accordingly, You are not guilty and You are guilty’ — M.E., ShaK a.o. provided he [the litigant] does not upset his former pleas.5e., there is a controversy between them, viz., the Judge says, You pleaded thus, and the litigants contradict him, in which case the Judge is not believed when they are no longer before him (and according to ShaK even if they are still before him) — M.E. This entire [ruling applies] only to one Judge;6E.g., an authoritative Judge (Mumḥeh) or where they accepted him as Judge (according to ShaK by means of Kinyan, but M.E. maintains that Kinyan is not necessary) — M.E. Thus Tur, Asheri and RIBaSh in Resp. but two [Judges] are always believed,7For then their statement is equivalent to evidence and they are believed — M.E. Even if it is not a case of discretionary judgment — Nethiboth. Cf. B.M. 32a; Tosef. B.M. I, 6. even if there are two witnesses who contradict them.8Asheri in Resp. advances the following reason: The Judge is more conscious of the case than those who merely hear the proceedings. If one Judge in conjunction with a single witness made this statement and two witnesses contradict them, the Judge and the single witness are not believed, since the single witness merely heard the proceedings. Consequently, there is only one against two — M.E. Gloss: So too, if they [the litigants] accepted an arbitrator [to bring about a settlement] within a certain time limit, — [the law is that with respect to] everything he [the arbitrator] states within the time limit, he is believed. However, if he had already recorded the settlement in writing and given [it] to them, he [subsequently] has no right to add or to subtract [therefrom] even within the time limit, although he states that thus was his [original] intention.9B.Yos. on the authority of RaShBA — G. , supra n.",

VI, 3: ‘Whoever makes a claim against his fellow, opens (his pleas) first.’ The meaning of the text in B.K. ibid. is as follows: When the litigants come to Court and the claimant desires that his pleas be heard first, and so too, the defendant — the practical difference being that the defendant might make a partial admission — and the law is that one who makes a partial admission is required to take a Biblical oath only if the admission was made after the plaintiff made his claim (v. infra § 88, 15) — the law is that we give prior consideration to the claimant. However, if the property of the defendant had depreciated in value or the reason he had not made payment prior to this was due to the fact that were he to dispose of his estate he would be forced to sell at a low price, — then we attend to the defendant first, and if the defendant makes a partial admission prior to hearing the pleas of the claimant, he is not required to take a Biblical oath — ShaK. However, if the property of the defendant [thereby] depreciates in value we give him prior consideration.2B.K. ibid.: ‘The Nehardeans said: Sometimes we attend to the defendant first, e.g., where his property depreciates in value.’ Gloss: e., A makes a claim against B3According to Rashi (v. supra § 16, n. 5) it refers to a case where the defendant has an opportunity of selling his property now at a high price — an opportunity which will not present itself later — then we give prior consideration to the defendant’s counter-claim. , ShaK (supra n. 1) for another interpretation. in a case where [B] cannot say, 'I have [already] paid,'4Thus B.K. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. שאין according to Rashi’s explanation. We deal here with a case where there is a document signed by witnesses that he lent him money — M.E. Cf. infra § 85, 7. and B responds [by making a counter-claim, viz.,] 'You have so much of mine in your possession'5Tur has, ‘And B responds, You have taken possession of aught that belongs to me; return to me whatever you have seized,’ or he says, ‘You had my pledge and it has depreciated in value.’ Even if the claimant admits to the defendant that the pledge has depreciated in value (save that they differ as to the amount of depreciation), — nevertheless, we give prior consideration to the claimant — M.E. and he requests [an extension of] time — more than thirty days — [in order] to produce witnesses, — [thirty days being] the time [usually given] by Court,6For were B to request only thirty days, the usual extension of time given by the Court, we would have complied with his wish even if his property were not to depreciate in value. But if he requests a longer extension of time in order to produce witnesses, and we are not aware that there are witnesses available,—then even if B’s, property depreciates in value, we do not listen to him. We deal here with a case where the Judges of the Court know that he has witnesses who are acquainted with the facts, but we do not know whether the witnesses will testify in favour of the defendant or not — M.E. , supra § 16, 1 and notes. — [the law is that] although we know that he [the defendant] has witnesses who are acquainted with the case, we [still] give prior consideration to the claimant,7Tosaf. ibid. and he [the defendant] is obliged to pay him forthwith8e., if he has money and desires to obtain an extension of time only to clarify his counter-claim and to deduct this from the loan; but if he has no money, we give him only thirty days to secure funds — M.E. unless his [the defendant's] property depreciates in value and the defendant [thereby] suffers a loss.9e., the Beth Din see that the defendant will suffer a loss thereby, e.g., if he does not sell his pledge now (which according to him is in the claimant’s possession), we give the defendant prior consideration and grant him his request for an extension of time even more than thirty days. Or if the Beth Din see that there will be a depreciation of his property or the like. So too, if the claimant desires that they hear his pleas first, [i.e.,] prior to hearing the pleas of the defendant,10e., A (the claimant) does not insist to be paid first but rather to have his pleas heard first. Consequently, ‘unless his (B’s) property depreciates in value’ means that if they hear A’s pleas first, then B is designated a ‘defendant’ and thereby his property will depreciate in value. Likewise, if A desires that his witnesses be heard first and B makes the same claim, we give prior consideration to A. Consequently, ‘unless (B’s) property depreciates in value’ means that B’s witnesses might leave and go to a distant country if they are not heard forthwith — M.E. or he requests the Court of Law not to issue the verdict at present save when he so desires,11Tur on the authority of RaBaD — G. Tur adds: ‘For perhaps today or the next day he might find witnesses or the defendant will make an admission.’ This applies even if they made an agreement with the claimant by means of a Kinyan to be tried before the Court of Law and he had already presented his documents — nevertheless, he may state that he desires to be dismissed and not to be tried now (it follows that if he had already presented his pleas this does not apply), unless the property of the defendant depreciates in value (RaShBA) — M.E. or [in a case] where the defendant is under obligation to him [the claimant] to take an oath and the claimant states that he desires not that he [the defendant] swear to him now save when he [the claimant] so desires12N.Yos. — G. , supra § 16, n. 2. and likewise in all similar cases, e.g., when he [the claimant] says that he has many [additional] claims against this [defendant] and he desires not to make [all these] claims at present,13, however, infra § 87, 24, Gloss according to which Isserles holds that the claimant is told to make all his claims which contradicts the present ruling. ShaK removes this difficulty by explaining that Isserles concludes infra that if the claimant refuses to make all his claims, the defendant takes an oath and is exempt; whereas in the present ruling we deal with a case where the claimant states that he does not care if the defendant takes an oath because even if he takes an oath he will not be exempt since he has additional claims against the defendant where the question of an oath does not enter or where he will be able to produce witnesses. For additional interpretations, v., M.E. and P.Tesh. — [then] we listen to the claimant unless the property of the defendant [thereby] depreciates in value,14B.Yos. on the authority of RaShBeẒ — G. Where A made a claim against B and the latter refused to respond being a very stern and powerful individual (אלם) and subsequently B made a claim against A, — the law is that A is not required to respond until B responds first (D.M. on the authority of MaHaRIW) — M.E. or where the defendant suffers a loss on account of this according to the discernment of the Judges.",

    "text_en": "Every Judge1‘Judge’ is expressly stated to indicate that we deal here only with one who is an authoritative Judge (Mumḥeh) or one who is not a Mumḥeh but was accepted by the litigants to try the case, or three laymen even if they were not accepted by the litigants. However, the decision of one or two laymen is not considered valid even if authorization was obtained from the Resh Galutha (Exilarch) and even if the decision was not given in error — M.E. Thus Alfasi, viz., that the litigant may retract even if they (one or two laymen) did not err. But if it is impossible to retract, e.g., where one left for abroad or the like (v. Caro anon), the Judge must make restitution from his own pocket even if he did not take aught from one litigant and give to the other litigant with his own hand. For even where the Judge took and gave with his own hand, and in reality this should be returned by the litigant who received it in error, the Judge must pay the litigant who suffered a loss, and then collect from the other litigant who received payment on account of the erroneous decision of the Judge. RaZaH contra Alfasi rules that since the decision is invalid, then even if the layman Judge took and gave with his own hand, he is exempt from making payment, for the litigant is responsible since he knew well that the decision of such a Judge is invalid. If the Judge compelled the litigant to give aught to the other litigant, he is considered a robber and must make restitution. ShaK rules in accord with Alfasi where the Judge took and gave with his own hand. who adjudicated monetary cases and gave an erroneous decision — [the law is that] if he erred in evident and known matters, e.g., laws that are explicitly stated in the Mishna2Yad, Sanhedrin VI,  Derived from Mishna San. 32a: ‘In monetary cases the verdict may be reversed (on discovering that the verdict was erroneous) either (from conviction) to acquittal or (from acquittal) to conviction.’ Gemara ibid. 33a: ‘But the following disagrees with it: If one adjudicated a case (by himself) and pronounced him who was guilty, not guilty, or the one who was not guilty, guilty; the clean, unclean, or vice versa: his verdict stands, but he must pay compensation (for any damage resulting from his erroneous decision) out of his own pocket (Mishna Bek. 28b. Thus we see that the verdict may not be reversed)? — R. Joseph stated: There is no contradiction: here it (our Mishna) has reference to a Mumḥeh (He had authority to upset his former decision); there (Mishna Bek.) to one who is not a Mumḥeh (His decision stands but he must pay indemnity). But do we reverse the verdict in the case of a Mumḥeh? Have we not learned: If he was recognized by the Beth Din as a Mumḥeh he is exempt from making payment! — R. Naḥman replied: Here (in our Mishna) we deal with a case where there is a Court superior to this one in learning and numbers (therefore, the superior Court can reverse the verdict of the lower Court); but in the other Mishna there is no other Court superior to this one in learning and numbers (i.e., in both Mishnahs the verdict was issued by a Mumḥeh, but where there is no superior Court available, one of the litigants may oppose reversing the verdict). R. Shesheth answered: Here we deal with a case where he (the Judge) overlooked a law cited in a Mishna (Hence, the verdict may be reversed); there he erred in weighing of opinions. For R. Shesheth stated on the authority of R. Assi: If he overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, the verdict is reversed; if he erred in weighing of opinions, the verdict is not reversed. Rabina asked R. Ashi: Is this also applicable if he erred in connection with a teaching of R. Ḥiyya or R. Oshaia (who were held to be the editors of the Tosefta which is not as authoritative as the Mishna)? — Yes, he answered. And even with respect to a saying of Rab and Samuel (whose dicta were not as authoritative as the Tosefta)? — Yes, he answered. Even regarding a law stated by you and me? — Are we reed-cutters in a marsh (i.e., illiterate), he answered. What is meant by the statement, Weighing of (conflicting) opinions? — R. Papa stated, E.g., if two Tannaim or Amoraim are in dispute and it was not stated with whom the law accords and it happened that he (the Judge) ruled according to the opinion of one of them, whilst the general practice (accepted by the majority of Judges. Thus Rashi) follows the other (opinion), — this is considered a case of (erring) in the weighing of (conflicting) opinions … R. Ḥisda stated (in order to remove the contradiction between the Mishnahs supra): Here (the Mishna in Bek.) we deal with a case where he (the Judge) took with his own hand (from one litigant) and gave (to the other in which case the verdict stands); here (the Mishna in San.) where he did not take and give with his own hand (in which case the verdict is reversed).’ Hence, our ruling is in accord with R. Shesheth. Cf. also Ket. 100a; Sheb. 38b; San. 6a. or in the Gemara3San. 33a in accord with Rabina’s query presented to R. Ashi. , text in previous note. or in the rulings of the Codifiers,4Tur on the authority of Asheri and Kes. Mish. to Yad ibid. Derived from San. ibid. , supra n. 2: ‘Are we reed-cutters in a marsh?’ Regarding a Talmudic question which remains unanswered (תיקו) where the law is that ‘the claimant must produce evidence,’ and the Judge erred in his verdict by giving a decision according to which the possessor should relinquish the disputed article — it is regarded as ‘overlooking a law cited in the Mishna’ (N.Yos.), and if the Judge had already given the litigant a right to seize the article, — the law is that this hinges on the difference of opinion stated by the Codifiers whether ‘taking possession’ in the case of a disputed article concerning which the Talmud leaves the question undecided, is valid or not. Tummim holds that possession in this case is valid save that the other party has a right to demand payment by the Judge. Nethiboth, however, states that the Judge is exempt from making payment according to all authorities. the verdict is reversed and it [the case] is adjudicated in accordance with the law.5Even if they were three authoritative Judges (Mumḥin) and were accepted by the litigants to try the case, since they erred in a law cited in the Mishna — Tur and Asheri. Gloss: Yet some say that if it appears to the Judge and to his contemporaries6B.B. 130b-131a: ‘Raba said to R. Papa and to R. Huna the son of R. Joshua: When a (written) verdict of mine comes before you, and you see in it something objectionable, do not tear it up until you come before me. If I have a (well-grounded) reason (for my verdict) I will tell (it to) you; if not, I will retract. After my death, you shall neither tear it up nor derive (any law) from it. You shall neither tear it up because were I there, I might have told you the reason; nor derive (any law) from it, because a Judge must be governed only by what his eyes discern.’ According to RaShBaM (s.v. ולא תגמרו) it means: ‘Do not pronounce judgment on the basis of my verdict but issue your ruling in accord with the opinion which you are inclined to accept because everything depends upon the discernment of the Judge.’ From this we infer that one may rule in accordance with one’s opinion and discernment even in the case where it is contrary to the written verdict of his teacher. on the strength of indisputable proof7, Yeb. 42b-43a whence we see that once during a debate by Amoraim concerning an anonymous Mishna, the latter was disregarded and was not considered authoritative in the face of a valid and well-grounded objection. that the law does not accord with that mentioned in the Codifiers, he can differ with it,8Even contra the Geonim if it is not explicitly mentioned in the Talmud — Tur and Asheri. since it is [a law that is] not mentioned [explicitly] in the Gemara.9Tur on the authority of Asheri — G. , B.M. 86a where it is stated that R. Ashi and Rabina arranged the vast material which accumulated up to their times and they represented the authentic body of legislation as editors of the Talmud. Consequently, the body of teachings edited by them represented the authoritative Code and hence, a law not mentioned in the Talmud could be disputed. Nevertheless, one should not adopt a leniency in a matter that the [authors of] the [former] compilations [on Hebrew Law] that have spread among the large majority of Israelites were stringent, unless one has it on tradition from his teachers that we do not adopt that stringency.10Decisions of Isserlein s. 241 — G. , A.Z. 36a whence RaN derives three important principles, a) If a prohibition issued by one Court has spread among the large majority of Israelites, another Court cannot annul this decision even if it is superior to the former Court in wisdom and numerical strength; b) If the prohibition of one Court has not spread among the large majority of Israelites, but the majority of people are able to abide by it, then another Court that is superior to the former Court in wisdom and numerical strength can annul the decision; c) If the prohibition of one Court did not spread among the large majority of Israelites because the majority of people are not able to abide by it, then even another Court that is inferior in wisdom and numerical strength can annul it. The law stated here refers to ritual law, for in civil suits the claimant is required to produce evidence — M.E. However, if it is impossibe to reverse [the verdict], e.g., where the one who received the money illegally [as a result of the erroneous decision] left for abroad or [in a case] where he is a stern individual [and refuses to return the money] or where [the Judge] pronounced aught that, is 'clean,' 'unclean,' or gave a decision regarding a Kosher animal that it is Terefah and they gave it to the dogs to eat, or anything similar to this, — [the law is that] these are [cases where] he [the Judge] is exempt from making compensation11San. 33a: ‘R. Hamnunah raised an objection against R. Shesheth (v. supra n. 2): It once happened that a cow’s womb was removed and R. Tarfon gave it to the dogs to eat (i.e., he declared the cow Terefah). When the case was presented before the Sages in Yabneh, they declared her permissible (for human consumption), for Theodos (or Theodoros), the Physician said that no cow or sow leaves Alexandria of Egypt unless the womb is first cut out, in order that she may not breed (This precaution was taken so as to limit its breeding only to Egypt and thus compel buyers to come to Alexandria). Said R. Tarfon: Your ass is gone, Tarfon! (i.e., I will now have to sell my ass in order to compensate the owner of the cow for having erroneously declared it Terefah). But R. Akiba said to him: You are exempt from reparation, since he who is publicly recognized as a Mumḥeh is exempt from making compensation (Mishna Bek. 28b; San. 93a). Now, if your opinion (R. Shesheth that one who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may reconsider his verdict) has substance, he (R. Akiba) should have said to him: You overlooked a law cited in the Mishna (cf. Mishna Hul. 54a: If the womb is gone the animal is not rendered Terefah) and he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may reconsider his verdict (Hence, even if R. Tarfon were not an expert, he should be exempt. Consequently, if the cow were still here, R. Tarfon could rescind the verdict and therefore the person who gave it to the dogs should be held responsible)! — He (R. Akiba) gave him two reasons: Firstly, you have overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, and he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may rescind his verdict. Secondly, Even if your error was made against common practice (Lit. ‘weighing of opinions’), you are a publicly recognnized Mumḥeh, and as such you are exempt from making reparation. Said R. Naḥman b. Isaac to Raba: What is the objection that R. Hamnunah raised against R. Shesheth from the case of the cow? But the cow had already been given to the dogs to eat and was no longer in existence for it to be returned to its owner (i.e., a reconsideration of the verdict would be of no avail)! — This is what he meant: Were you to say that one who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may not reconsider the verdict, it is right, for then the verdict stands and R. Tarfon was fearful and (R. Akiba) said to him: You are recognized by the Beth Din as a Mumḥeh and exempt from reparation. But if you say that he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may reconsider his verdict, then (R. Akiba) should have said to him: Since if the cow were still available your verdict would have been invalid and you would have done nothing, so too, now (that the cow is no longer in existence) you have done nothing (i.e., you did not give it to the dogs yourself and it was the owner’s bad luck to have carried out your verdict [v. B.K. 100a]. Consequently, since R. Akiba did not present this argument, we conclude therefrom that if one overlooks a law cited in the Mishna, he must not reconsider the verdict).’ The present ruling accords with the interpretation of R. Ḥisda in removing the contradiction between the Mishnahs in San. and Bek. , supra n. 2. and although he was the cause of the damage, he did not cause damage intentionally.12e., even according to R. Meir who adjudicates liability in an action of damage done indirectly (B.K. 100a) and which is the accepted law, in the present ruling all authorities agree that the Judge is not held responsible, for were this not so, no person would be willing to become a Judge. However, if the Judge took and gave with his hand even without having to resort to force, he is held responsible even if he overlooked a law cited in the Mishnah — ShaK. M.E. and BaḤ differ with ShaK and maintain that since the Judge did not have the express intention to cause damage, then even if he took and gave with his hand, the law is that if he over-looked a law cited in the Mishnah, he is not held responsible. Gloss: And some differ [with this opinion].13Tur on the authority of Asheri and other Codifiers — G. e., the Judge is held responsible in a case where the article cannot be returned and the Judge erred by overlooking a law cited in the Mishna and we follow R. Meir’s opinion. As to the case of R. Tarfon (v. supra n. 11), it accords with the view of the Sages who oppose R. Meir and hold that liability is not adjudicated in an action of damage done indirectly. , supra n. 12. The dissentient view holds that even three Mumḥin who were accepted by the litigants are held responsible because we follow R. Meir’s opinion that liability is adjudicated in an action of damage done indirectly — M.E. ShaK concludes that if he is a publicly recognized Judge and was accepted by the litigants, then even according to the dissentient view recorded here, the Judge is exempt contra M.E. Tummim agrees with ShaK, but states that if the Judge took and gave with his own hand, although he is legally exempt yet as far as acting beyond the requirement of the law is concerned, he is held responsible. However, if he did not take and give with his own hand and erred in a law cited in the Mishna and is a Mumḥeh, — then even from the point of acting beyond the requirement of the law he is exempt as in the case of R. Akiba who exempted R. Tarfon and did not consider him liable beyond the requirements of the law. If one asks the advice of a Sage whether he should purchase certain meat or fruit, and the latter informed him that the fruit is ‘clean’ or the meat ‘Kosher’ and on the strength of this advice he purchased same and subsequently, it was found that the Sage had erred — ShaK holds that if he overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, the purchase is invalid and he may retract; but if he erred ‘in the weighing of opinions’ the purchaser may not retract save that the Sage or Judge is liable to make compensation if he is not a recognized authority but was only accepted by the litigants. Tummim disputes this ruling and maintains that the purchase is void and the vendor must return the money and take back his fruit or meat. And with regards to decisions in ritual law, — if he [the Judge] has attained [the age of] ordination, although he is not [officially] ordained, his legal status is as that of an authoritative [Judge].14N.Yos. to San. IV beg. — G. This ruling according to N.Yos. refers to a Judge who erred in ‘weighing of opinions’ in a monetary suit but not to one who erred in a law cited in the Mishna in which case the Judge is legally held responsible to make compensation unless he is an authoritative Judge ordained by the Court in the Land of Israel, or has authorization from the Resh Galutha; but in ritual law (איסור והיתר) if the Judge is an expert who is versed in the law (גמיר) and has the capacity for making logical deductions (סביר), he is not held responsible. Consequently, since the present ruling refers only to one who erred in a law cited in the Mishna, Isserles should have stated this law in the next par. which deals with the law of ‘erring in the weighing of opinions’ — M.E. ShaK writes that no distinction should be made between monetary and ritual cases contra N.Yos. and Isserles. , Y.D. § 242 on the law of Ordination nowadays.",

    "text_en": "[If] he [the Judge] erred in weighing of opinions, e.g., [in] a case regarding which there is a dispute among Tannaim or Amoraim15Likewise in the case of a controversy among the Codifiers nowadays — ShaK. and the Halachah was not decided in accordance with [the views of] either of them explicitly16Yad, Sanhedrin VI,  Derived from San. 33a in accord with R. Papa. , text supra n.  and he acted in accordance with [the view of] one of them and he knew not17e., he was only aware that the matter is in dispute; but if the Judge was aware of one opinion only, according to which he rendered his decision, his verdict stands and he does not make compensation — M.E. ShaK cites dissenting views with which he is inclined to agree on the principle that ‘an error in study amounts to a wilful act’ (Aboth IV, 13). Consequently, where the Judge should have known the opposing viewpoint, it is self-evident that he is considered as having given an erroneous decision (cf. case of R. Tarfon supra n. 11 whose erroneous decision was the result of lack of study). However, in the case where the Judge was not expected to know about the other viewpoint (e.g., where a certain source of law was unknown in his locality), this comes under the rule of force majeure (אונס) and his decision stands. In any case, he is not held liable. If there exists no controversy concerning a certain matter of law save that the law is not explicit thereon, and the accepted practice is based on a logical deduction or the like, and the Judge ruled contra the accepted practice, he is regarded as one who erred in a law cited in the Mishna — ShaK. that the general practice had already spread throughout the world18Thus Yad ibid. , however, explanation of Rashi on ‘general practice’ supra n.  ‘Throughout the world’ does not exclude a certain country or district on the principle that ‘everything is according to the custom of the district’ — ShaK. Where no ‘general practice’ prevails the Judge should render his decision on the basis of the inclination of his personal judgment — N.Yos. on the authority of R. Jonah. in accordance with [the views of] the other [authority], — [then] if this Judge was an expert [Mumḥeh] and obtained authorization from the Resh Galutha19Yad ibid. Derived from San. 5a: ‘Rab stated: Whoever desires to render decisions in monetary cases by himself and be exempt from liability (in the case of giving an erroneous decision) should obtain authorization from the Resh Galutha.’ This is applicable even if the Judge took from one and gave to the other with his own hand on the principle that ‘confiscation by the Court (i.e., disposing of private property by the process of law) is valid’ (הפקר בית דין הפקר). , Yeb. 89b; Git. 36b. or [even] if he obtained no authorization but the litigants accepted him,20Derived from San. 5a regarding Mar Zutra b. R. Naḥman and Rabbah b. Ḥana who each adjudicated a case alone and gave an erroneous decision and they were informed that if the litigants accepted them as their Judges, they are not obliged to make restitution. Cf. also Mishna and Gemara Bek. 28b whence we derive that if a Judge issues an erroneous decision, the verdict stands but the Judge must make restitution, the reason in this case being that he executed the judgment alone, and in the latter part of the Mishna (Bek. ibid.) it states that if the Judge was a Mumḥeh, he is exempt from making restitution, even if he executes the judgment alone since the litigants accepted him. , also Bek. ibid. in the case of the cow (supra n. 11) the statement of R. Akiba to R. Tarfon: ‘You are exempt from reparation since he who is publicly recognized as a Mumḥeh is exempt from making compensation. In the present ruling since the parties accepted him it is equivalent to one who was a Mumḥeh. The law here obtains even if the parties did not accept him explicitly by means of a Kinyan, but merely appeared before the Judge for trial of their own accord — ShaK. — [the law is that] since he is an expert,21Even nowadays if one possesses vast erudition in the Talmud and Codes and has a logical mind and is experienced in legal matters and does not err, he is regarded as a Mumḥeh. Although Isserles supra § 3, 2 writes that ‘nowadays we do not conduct proceedings of adjudication (of monetary cases) by a recognized Mumḥeh’ — he refers to adjudication by a single Judge, but regarding the obligation to make payment in the case of an erroneous decision, the law is applicable nowadays too. The Judge, however, must be a publicly recognized authority and we do not accept his word if he states, ‘I am an authoritative Judge’ — ShaK. the verdict is reversed.22There is no question that the verdict is reversed where the Judge did not execute the judgment personally by his own hand in which case Caro following Alfasi and Maim. holds that even if he is not an authoritative Judge the verdict is upset (v. infra par. 3), but even if he personally executed the judgment by his own hand and is not obliged to make restitution, the verdict is reversed on account of the loss suffered by the innocent party. Isserles (infra par. 3) cites a dissenting opinion (Asheri and Tur) that even if the Judge did not execute the judgment personally by his own hand, the verdict stands and the Judge must make restitution — M.E., ShaK. If, however, it is impossible to reverse [the verdict],23, supra par. 1. he is absolved from making compensation. Gloss: [The decision of] three laymen is regarded as [that of] an individual expert.24e., if the parties accepted them they are not liable in the case of an erroneous decision — M.E. With regards to acceptance of the Judges there is the following distinction to be made between an authoritative Judge (Mumḥeh) and three laymen: In the former case appearance for trial is tantamount to valid acceptance so that if the Judge errs, he is not held liable; whereas in the latter case the litigants must state explicitly that they accept the laymen to act as Judges — Nethiboth. Cf. San. 4b-5a: ‘Our Rabbis taught: Monetary suits are tried by three; but one who is publicly recognized as an authoritative Judge (Mumḥeh) may judge alone.’ Hence, the first part of this passage must deal with three laymen Judges. , Tosaf. ibid. s.v. דן. , supra § 3 in what manner obtaining authorization from the ruler is effective. One should not say 'I will render a decision in agreement with whomever I desire' pertaining to a matter wherein there is a difference of opinion [among the authorities];25This means that there is no general practice prevalent. Otherwise it would be regarded as erring in weighing of opinions (שקול הדעת) — ShaK. Cf. A.Z. 7a: ‘Our Rabbis taught: If one consulted a Sage who pronounced (aught) as unclean, he should not consult another Sage who might pronounce it as clean; if one Sage pronounced (aught) as forbidden, one should not consult another Sage who might pronounce it as permitted. If of two Sages, one pronounces (aught) as unclean and the other as clean, one forbids and the other permits, then if one of them is superior to the other in learning and in numbers (of disciples), his ruling should be followed, otherwise, the one who adopts the stricter view should be followed. R. Joshua b. Korḥa states: In laws (stated explicitly) in the Torah, adopt the stricter view; in laws (enacted) by the Scribes (the Soferim from the time of Ezra and on), adopt the lenient view. Said R. Joseph: The Halachah rests with R. Joshua b. Korḥa.’ Hence, we see that there are specific rules to be followed in giving decisions and one has no right to adopt a dissenting view without a well-grounded reason. and if one acts thus it is regarded as a false verdict unless if he is a distinguished scholar and knows [how] to harmonize [the conflicting views] by [well-grounded] proofs, he has the authority [to act thus]; but if he is incapable for this, he should not exact money [as a result] of uncertainty, for wherever there exists a doubt regarding the [accepted] law, we do not exact money from the possessor.26Tur — G. And if it is concerning ritual law and it is a matter involving a Biblical prohibition, one should adopt the restrictive view; and if it involves a Rabbinical matter, one should adopt the lenient view and [provided] only if the two dissenting [authorities] are equals; but one should not rely on the statements of a minor [authority] as opposed to the statements of one superior to him in wisdom and in numbers [of disciples or followers]27A.Z. ibid. , supra n. 25. even in a time of emergency28‘Even in a time of emergency’ should come after ‘as opposed to a majority.’ Cf. Nid. 9b. unless it also involved a serious loss.29, Nid. ibid. Likewise, if it was a case of an individual authority as opposed to a majority, — [then] we follow the majority30e., in ritual matters. everywhere.31RaShBA s. 253 — G. And even if the majority [of authorities] agree, not because of the same reason, only each one [of them] has his own individual argument, — [then the law is that] since they concur regarding the law — they are regarded as a majority and we adopt their opinion.32MaHaRIK Rt. 41 — G. Derived from San. 18b regarding three oxherds whose conversation was overheard by the Rabbis in which each one stated a different reason for intercalating the year and thereupon the Rabbis intercalated the year. Cf. however, Y. San. I, 2(18c) bot.; Y. R.H. II, 5(58b) top where R. Ze‘ira pointed out that this holds good only when they all agree on one point. The explanation given in Y. is that since in principle they agree that the year should be intercalated, it is as though they all had a common reason. Hence, Y. would not be the source of MaHaRIK’s ruling but rather B. , Ziyyun Yerushalayyim to Y. San. ibid. and Be’er Eliyahu. In the case of a Biblical prohibition (איסור לאורייתא) we do not follow the lenient view where the authorities advance different arguments for adopting the lenient view. This applies only if the decision of each authority is based on arguments found in compilations of Law. However, if the authorities are present before us, we follow their lenient view as in the case of the Sanhedrin where it was not necessary for each member to advance the same argument. Where two Judges derive the same argument from two Biblical verses, they are counted as one, for a single teaching cannot be derived from different Scriptural verses (v. San. 34a). But when derived from the Mishna, Gemara and Codes, the arguments are counted as two — ShaK. If the prevailing custom in town is to adopt a lenient view [in a certain matter] because one Sage had [once] ruled for them thus, we follow his opinion,33 Shab. 130a where the views of individual Sages were adopted in their localities although the majority of the Sages were opposed to their ruling. and if [subsequently] another Sage arrived and prohibits what they [the townspeople] permit [in accordance with the lenient view of the former Sage], one must act in accordance with the prohibition [of the latter Sage].34RaShBA Resp. 253 — G. , ‘Er. 41a: ‘In the generation of R. Gamaliel people acted in accordance with the views of R. Gamaliel, but in the generation of R. Jose (who flourished after R. Gamaliel) people acted in accordance with the views of R. Jose.’ The same applies where the former authority adopted a restrictive view and the latter followed a lenient view — ShaK. Wherever the statements of the former [authorities] are recorded in writing and are well-known, and the later Codifiers differ with the former as [we find] that at times the Codifiers oppose the [views] of the Geonim, we follow the [views of the] later [authorities], for the Halachah rests with the later authorities beginning with Abaye and Raba onwards.35MaHaRIK Rt. 84 — G. However, if at times we find a Geonic Responsum which was not recorded in writing and [the opinions of] other [authorities] are found to conflict with it, it is not required to render a decision in accordance with the views of the later authorities, for it is possible that they were unaware of the opinions of the Gaon, and had they heard of them, they would retract.36MaHaRIK Rt. 96 — G. Thus Asheri to Ber. 24a and cf. Shab. 61a. Although the ruling is that we follow the later authorities, nevertheless, this principle is applicable only when the later authority clarifies his viewpoint on the basis of well-grounded arguments and proof (R. Moses Ruttenberg) — P.Tesh. , also Tummim on principles to be followed in this matter.",

Likewise, Mumḥeh mentioned supra par. 2 has the same meaning. But if he is unversed in the law and does not possess reasoning power, obtaining authorization has no legal effect — ShaK contra M.E. for the Court of Law and had not obtained authorization [from the Resh Galutha]38 Glos. and the litigants did not accept him,39 supra n. 20. or [if] he was not an expert37Heb. מומחה. e., he is versed in the law and possesses reasoning power. Likewise, Mumḥeh mentioned supra par. 2 has the same meaning. But if he is unversed in the law and does not possess reasoning power, obtaining authorization has no legal effect — ShaK contra M.E. but the litigants accepted him to adjudicate the case for them and he [the Judge] erred in the weighing of opinions40Derived from the first part of Mishna Bek. 28b in accord with R. Ḥisda (v. supra n. 2) where the Judge was not an expert (Mumḥeh), (since the latter part of the Mishna (ibid.) deals with a Judge who was a Mumḥeh) and it treats of a case where the litigants accepted him as their Judge (v. San. 6a). If the parties accepted one who was unversed in the law, his verdict stands, provided he did not give an erroneous decision. If Judges who were unversed in the law erred in the weighing of opinions, the verdict becomes void and has no legal effect unless an agreement was made with the litigants by means of a Kinyan — Nethiboth. — [then] if he had taken [from one] and given [to the other] with his own hand, his act cannot be undone, and he must pay indemnity from his own pocket. However, if he had not taken [from one] and given [to the other] with his own hand, the verdict is reversed.41In accord with R. Ḥisda. , text supra n. 2. Likewise, if the Court messenger executed the judgment personally with his own hand following the instructions of the Court, it is as though the Court itself acted thus — Tummim. And if it is impossible to reverse [the verdict],42 supra par. 1. he must pay from his own pocket.43In all the aforementioned rulings, Yad (source of Caro’s ruling) follows Alfasi save in the present ruling where Alfasi exempts the Judge — M.E. Gloss: Some say that even if he had not taken [from one] and given [to the other] with his own hand, his act cannot be undone and he must pay indemnity from his own pocket44Even if the litigant is available and can pay, he is free from liability because the verdict stands and the Judge must make compensation — Nethiboth. and the verdict is not reversed.45Asheri and Tur — G. This follows the opinion of those authorities who maintain that we do not adopt the explanation of R. Ḥisda who makes a distinction between executing the judgment personally or not, for R. Ḥisda’s explanation follows the opinion of the Sages who hold that we do not adjudicate liability for damage done indirectly. Hence, the Judge is liable only if he executes the judgment personally with his own hand. We, however, follow R. Meir who maintains that we adjudicate liability for damage done indirectly. , supra nn. 12 and 1 As to the conflict between the Mishnas in San. and Bek. (v. supra n. 2), we accept the explanation of R. Shesheth and it matters not whether the Judge is an expert (Mumḥeh) and the litigants did not accept him, or if he is not an expert and the parties accepted him. If, however, the Judge pronounced the innocent, guilty, and the latter had not yet made payment, the verdict is reversed since the judgment was not carried out — ShaK contra M.E. It should be noted that when we speak of carrying out the judgment with one’s hand (נשא ונתן ביד), it refers to carrying out the entire judgment, but if only part of the judgment was executed, it is legally effective only in proportion to that part — Nethiboth contra K.H. This is applicable where they [the litigants] had not accepted them [the Judges to abide by their decision] whether [given] in accordance with the law or whether [given] in error;46Derived from San. 6a: (ref. to ‘If one tried a case by himself and declared the guilty, not guilty … act cannot be undone’): ‘..Here we deal with a case where the litigants accepted the Judge. If so, why should he make compensation? — Because they had said to him: We agree to abide by your award on condition that you issue a verdict in accordance with the Torah.’ Caro’s text follows the reading of Alfasi and Asheri (San. ibid.) that the litigants said to the Judge, ‘We accepted you on condition that you issue a verdict in accordance with the Torah, but we did not accept you to give an erroneous decision.’ but if they accepted them whether [to abide by their decision] in accordance with the law or whether [given] in error,47Tur and Alfasi — G. If the Judge whom they accepted was a Mumḥeh then even if the litigants explicitly stated, ‘Give us a decision in accordance with the Torah,’ the acceptance is valid and in the case of an erroneous decision, the Judge is absolved from making compensation — ShaK. The present ruling is applicable even if no agreement was entered into by means of a Kinyan. However, if they accepted individuals who are entirely unversed in the law, then Kinyan is required, for such a case is on an equal footing with arbitration (v. supra § 12) — Nethiboth. or nowadays where the community compels the Judges by means of the ban48Likewise if they are compelled on account of a penalty that would be imposed upon them — Tummim contra ShaK. to act as Judges against their will, — they [the Judges] must not pay indemnity even if they gave an erroneous decision,49 San. 3a where we are informed that in monetary suits even laymen may act as Judges so as ‘not to bolt the door against borrowers’ (for creditors will refuse to grant loans were they to be subjected to collecting their debts by Mumḥin). The Gemara asks why should non-Mumḥin not be protected against a claim of compensation in the event that they give an erroneous decision? The very same reason (‘so as not to bolt the door against borrowers’) is given. But this reason is applicable only where the laymen Judges tried the case willingly. However, it follows that where they were compelled to act as Judges, the above reason does not apply. Hence, they must not pay indemnity in the case of an erroneous decision. for what could they have done?50For this very reason a Mumḥeh who was accepted by the litigants is exempt in the case of an erroneous decision, for one who is a Mumḥeh is under compulsion to act as Judge. , supra § 10, 3: ‘Yea, a mighty host are her slain — refers to one who has attained (the age of) ordination, but avoids giving decisions.’ Nevertheless, they should retract if they erred; and if they desire not to retract, they must pay indemnity.51Mord. to San. beg. — G. Before they executed the judgment they should reverse the verdict as in the case of every Judge who errs in the ‘weighing of opinions.’ And if they refuse to retract and exacted money after they became aware of the erroneous decision, they must make compensation. But if they became aware of the error after they executed the judgment, the verdict stands even in the case of Judges who were appointed by means of the ban (Ḥerem) — ShaK contra M.E. And when they gave an erroneous decision and must pay, — [the law is that] if all the Judges were collectively in agreement they must all pay [equal shares]; and if the Judges were only three [in number] and they [the litigants] followed [the erroneous decision of] two of them [representing the majority], they must pay [only] two shares and the litigant [who was erroneously pronounced guilty] suffers the loss of the third share;52San. 30a. For without the third Judge it would have been impossible to bring the legal proceedings to a close, since monetary suits are decided by three Judges, — consequently, each one of the two Judges pays a third, and the third Judge who did not concur with the other two is certainly exempt. but if the Judges were five [in number] and they [the litigants] followed [the erroneous decision of] three [Judges] who represented the majority, they [the three erring Judges] must share payment in full.53Tur — G. For in this case we cannot say that without the participation of the two dissenting Judges the legal proceedings would not have been brought to a close.",

But Raba maintained that we must pronounce the ban against him until he brings back the net and appears for trial before the Court. , supra § 4, n. 6. Hence, in the present ruling where one resorts to heathen Courts even Abaye would agree with Raba. For in the case of the net, if it is really his, there is no prohibition involved by giving it to the heathen Court; but where it still has to be ascertained whether the article is his, even Abaye will agree with Raba — Be’er Eliyahu. Likewise, is the ban pronounced against him who strengthens the hand[s] of the one who goes to law before a heathen [Court].7RIBaSh s. 102 — G. Sheb. 47b: ‘Simeon b.

XX, 13): thou shalt not cause adultery to be committed (the Heb. text may be pointed as the Hiph‘il). Hence, one who strengthens the hands of those who commit severe transgressions is also subject to the ban. Resorting to heathen Courts is a severe transgression. , supra n. 4.

Since he transgressed the law by resorting to a heathen lawcourt, we should not attend to his case. while others say that we do attend to his [case]11Mord. to B.K.

Thus also Tur a.o. Derived from B.K. 92b: ‘Whence do we derive the saying, When you have called your neighbour (cautioning him), and he would not answer, push down a big wall and throw it at him (he deserves to suffer)? — He answered: For it is written, Because I have purged thee and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more (Ez. XXIV, 13).’ Mishna Git. 88b (ref. to a Get given under compulsion): ‘However, the heathen authorities may beat a man and say to him, Do what the Israelitish (authorities) command you.’ If he refuses to appear, — [then] he obtains permission from the [Jewish] Court of Law and retrieves [his claim] through heathen Courts from the hand of his fellow-litigant15Provided two witnesses state that he refuses to appear in Court, for in order to exact money two witnesses are required — Tummim. This ruling is applicable only where the Court of Law knows that the defendant is legally guilty, e.g., where the claimant produces a note of indebtedness. But where the Court does not know whether the defendant is guilty, e.g., in the case of a verbal loan, — then the Court gives the claimant permission to use means of compulsion through the heathen Courts in order that the defendant appear for trial before the Jewish Court of Law — Nethiboth. We do not permit him to summon the defendant before heathen Courts unless it is impossible to collect the claim by means of an Adrakta — Ba‘al ha-Terumoth.. Gloss: The [members of the Jewish] Court of Law have the right to go before the heathen [Courts] and bear testimony that this party is guilty to that party.16Ba‘al ha-Terumoth on the authority of R. Sherira Gaon — G. Cf. B.K. 113b-114a: ‘Raba proclaimed or according to others, R. Huna: (Be it known to those) who go up to the Land of Israel and who come down from Babylonia that if a son of Israel knows evidence in favour of a heathen who did not call upon him (the Israelite to testify in his behalf) and (yet) went into a heathen Court and testified against a fellow-Israelite, they pronounce the Shammeta against him, the reason being that heathens exact money (even) on the testimony of a single witness. This applies only to a case of a single witness, but not if there were two.’ Hence, much more so in our present case where the Jewish Court of Law bears testimony on behalf of a fellow Israelite, it would be permissible. A.H. writes that this is applicable whether the claimant is Jewish or not. This entire [ruling is applicable] only when [the recalcitrant person] refuses to heed the [Jewish Court of] Law, but otherwise the [Jewish] Court of Law is forbidden to give [one] permission to appear for trial before a heathen [Court].17 supra par. 1.",

Mishna and Gemara ibid.: ‘For it is written, Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul (life) diligently (Deut. IV, 9. In Ber. 32a this verse is taken to mean that one should take good care of the body and its needs and not subject himself to dangers whence it is implied that it is forbidden to curse oneself) and … wherever it is said, take heed, lest, or not, it is nothing but a negative precept (Hence, in this verse take heed to thyself also means ‘do not invoke any curse upon thyself’).’ — by the [Divine] Name or by a substitute,3Mishna ibid.: ‘(If one said to witnesses, I adjure you) by Alef-Daleth (the first two letters of Adonai, the Lord) or by Yod-He (the Tetragrammaton) or by Shaddai (the Almighty) or by Ẓebaoth ([Lord] of Hosts) or by the Merciful and Gracious One, or by Him that is long-suffering and of great kindness, or by any of the substitutes of the Name, they are liable … If a man cursed himself or his fellow by any of them, he transgresses a negative precept.’ Gemara ibid. 36a: ‘R. Jannai said: This is the view of both (i.e., R. Meir and the Sages both agree that one who curses himself or his neighbour not merely by the Name, but even by any of the substitutes, transgresses a negative precept).’ or by one of the names that the heathens call the Holy One, Blessed be He,4 San. 60a whence it is derived that substitutes for the Divine Name employed by heathens are considered valid substitutes. Cf. also Ned. 3a, 10a where substitutes regarding vows are considered the foreign equivalents of the Hebrew. Thus Yad, Sanhedrin XXVI, 3 and Tur a.l. — if this took place in the presence of witnesses5 Deut. XIX, 15. and [was preceded by] warning,6 Ket. 33a. he receives lashes7Thus was the procedure in Temple days. Derived from Tem. 3a-b, 4a: ‘R. Iddi b. Abin stated on the authority of R. Amram, R. Isaac and R. Joḥanan: R. Jose the Galilean reported: With regards to every negative precept laid down in the Torah, if one performs an act (in violating it) he is punished with lashes, but if he does not perform an act (in violating it) he is exempt, save in the case of one who takes an oath, exchanges (an unconsecrated animal for one that is consecrated), and curses his fellow with the Name, in which cases, although he performed no act, he is punished (with lashes) … And he who curses his neighbour with the Name: Whence is this derived? — R. Eleazar stated on the authority of R. Oshaia: The text reads, If thou wilt not observe to do etc. (Deut. XXVIII, 58. The verse continues: That thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God, which intimates that one should not utter the Divine Name in vain and likewise one who curses his neighbour with the Divine Name is included in the same category). And it is written, Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful (v. 59). Now I do not know what is the nature of this wonder (peculiarity of punishment). But when it says (ibid. XXV, 2): That the judge cause him to lie down to be beaten (והפילו which is similar to the expression והפלא He will make … wonderful), this indicates that the wonderful (punishment) refers to punishment with lashes … Why not say … since he transgresses two things, first in uttering the Lord’s Name in vain and then in irritating his fellow, consequently, punishment with lashes should not suffice? — You cannot say thus, for it is written, Thou shalt not curse the deaf (Lev. XIX, 14 whether with or without the Divine Name).’ Thus also in Y. Sheb. IV, 10(35d) in accord with R. Jose contra the Colleagues. , however, RaBaD to Yad ibid. who on the basis of Y. ibid. deduces that if one cursed with a substitute he is not punished by lashes. It is only when he curses with the Tetragrammaton, although no act is performed, yet lashes are administered. , Kes. Mish. to Yad ibid. who defends Maim. against RaBaD’s stricture. on account of [the negative precept] 'Thou shalt not curse the deaf,'8Lev. XIX, 14. Actually the negative precept Thou shalt not curse the deaf includes all persons. The deaf was singled out, although he does not hear and is not subjected to any suffering, so that people should not take advantage of his infirmity. Thus Yad, Sanhedrin XXVI, 1 and Tur a.l. — M.E. Cf. also Sifra to Lev. ibid. and if [the cursed person] was a Judge, he receives additional lashes on account of [the negative precept] 'Thou shalt not curse the Judges.'9Ex. XXII, 27. Thus San. 66a. This, however, refers to a permanent Judge — P.Tesh. And [if one cursed by] Arur it is considered a form of curse.10Sheb. 36a. It must, however, contain the Name or its substitutes — M.E.",

For we might have thought that since transgressing this negative precept does not involve the performance of any act (v. supra nn. 6 and 7), consequently, warning should not be required, we are, therefore, informed otherwise. or where one uttered a curse without the [Divine] Name, or without a substitute, or the curse was the result of an implication [from] the words [that he uttered],12 supra par. 1. e.g., where he stated, 'May So-and-so not be blessed unto the Lord,' he receives no lashes.13Mishna Sheb. 35a in accord with the Sages. For when God withholds his blessing it follows that the person is under a curse — M.E. So too, one who curses the dead is exempt.14Tur — G. Yad, Sanhedrin XXVI,  Derived from Sifra ibid. , also Mishna San. 85b: ‘One who curses (his parents) after death is liable.’ Hence, since the verse His father or his mother he hath cursed (Lev. XX, 9) was singled out, it follows that for other dead he is not held liable. However, there is, nevertheless, a prohibition [against this]. If one put a scholar to shame, they pronounce the ban against him,15 Y.D. § 242 and § 334; Kid. 70b. , text supra § 7, n. 3 and if the Judges wish to inflict upon him the penalty of chastisement,16 supra § 8, 5, n. 45. This may mean either in addition to proclaiming the ban against him, or it means that if inflicting stripes for disobedience would be more effective, we administer the latter punishment — M.E. The penalty of chastisement is administered at the discretion of the Court and is Rabbinical in origin. , Maim. Comm. to Naz. IV, 3; Hul. 141b. Heb. מרדות according to Rashi is equivalent to רדיה ‘blows enforcing submission.’ This is inflicted for a past offence, but one who refuses to observe a positive precept, even if it is Rabbinical, they may admnister blows until his soul departs, if he is still stubborn, or until he observes the precept (Ket. 86a; Tosef. Mak. III, 10). they may strike him and [thus] punish him as much as they see fit.16 supra § 8, 5, n. 45. This may mean either in addition to proclaiming the ban against him, or it means that if inflicting stripes for disobedience would be more effective, we administer the latter punishment — M.E. The penalty of chastisement is administered at the discretion of the Court and is Rabbinical in origin. , Maim. Comm. to Naz. IV, 3; Hul. 141b.

Mak. III, 10). And if one put an illiterate person to shame, they punish him according to the demand of the hour,17B.K. 91a (ref. to Mishna ibid. 90a: ‘If he spat on his neighbour and the spittle reached him [he must pay him four hundred Zuz’]): Said R. Papa: This was taught only where it reached him (his person), but if only his garment, it is not so. But why should this not be equated to an insult in words? — It was said in the West on the authority of R. Jose b. Abin that this means that if he insulted him in words, he would be exempt from any liability.’ R. Sherira observes that what is meant here is that he is exempt from paying the above-mentioned sum, but it does not exclude punishment entirely. This may be seen from Mishna ‘Ar. 15a: ‘One who speaks with his mouth suffers more than he who commits an act.’ Hence, the Beth Din subjects him to a punishment according to their discretion. Consequently, the ruling here. [and according to the status of the one who puts to shame and the one put to shame],18Thus Yad ibid. even if the one put to shame (another version: the one cursed) has foregone [his honour], we punish him [the offender], for he had already committed a sin and had become guilty.19Tur — G. This Gloss should come at the end of par 1 — Be’er ha-Golah. Derived from Mak. 13b whence it is seen that the Earthly Tribunal does not grant remission to those who have become liable by sentence of a human Court, even if they should do penance. One who was sentenced to be placed under the ban because he acted contumaciously towards the Court of Law, and [the members of] the Court of Law wished to forego their honour and did not place him under the ban, they have a right to do so,20Yad, Sanhedrin XXVI, 6. Derived from Ket. 17a: ‘If a Nasi foregoes his honour, his honour is foregone.’ , Kes. Mish. ibid. provided [that as a result of the Court's leniency] there will not result in this matter a lessening of honour towards the Creator, e.g., where the people acted rebelliously towards the honour of the Torah and the Judges, — [then the law is that] since the people act contumaciously in [this matter], they [the Court of Law] should enforce measures [for the protection of the Law] and mete out punishment according to their discretion.21For sometimes adopting a leniency might lead to the profanation of the Name of Heaven. , Yoma 22b.",

There are those that disagree and say that once testimony has been accepted outside the court, it is okay after the fact. Therefore, if the party is strong and the witnesses are afraid to testify in front of him, we can accept the testimony not in front of the party, and judge accordingly. However, if it is possible to force the strong party in the way that was explained in paragraph 5 of this Siman, that would be preferred. There are those that say that the concept of not accepting testimony if not in front of the party is only by monetary cases, but not for quarreling and fighting where we are concerned that if they testify in front of the parties they will fight with one another and with the witnesses. The Geonim instituted that for such a case we accept testimony not in front of the parties and we do not reveal the identity of the witnesses. It seems to me that this is only where the court does not want to judge strict law and punish, but instead wants to quiet the fighting and rule based on the needs of the particular dispute.

If the witness said I erred, I made a mistake and now I remember the matter differently or I said it out of fear, we do not listen to him- even if he provides a rationale to his retraction. Similarly, he cannot add a condition to his testimony. (There are those that say he may add a condition) (Tur in the name of the Rosh). However, in a situation where it is clear that he erred, such as where the court demanded he bring witnesses to testify that he is not a fraudster, he brings them and the court asks him do you know him as a fraudster, and they say yes, and the party responds “you know that I am a fraudster?!” and they say we said you are not a fraudster, we believe their latter statement because it is assumed that a person does not bring witnesses to harm him and they certainly erred. Similarly, in any error that witnesses often make, they themselves are believed and there is no issue of re-testifying. Similarly, if they don’t contradict the substance of their words, such as where there words were vague and can be interpreted in one of two ways- one more probable than the other, we can conform their testimonies in any practical way in the same manner that we explain two witnesses that contradict each other in order that the testimonies conform. RAMA: In a situation where they placed a cherem in the synagogue that anyone who has testimony should testify before he leaves the synagogue, and the witnesses come after they leave the synagogue and say we didn’t recall at the time but now we remember, they may testify since they were originally silent and never said they did not know (Mordechai). Even in a case where they said they don’t know, if they can provide a rationale as to why they said it, they may testify since they did not say the reverse of what they said later (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rambam and the Tur)",

    "text_en": "Many Testified and One Was Discovered To Be a Relative or Disqualified, 2 Seifim: Paragraph 1- If there were numerous witnesses and one was discovered to be a relative or otherwise disqualified, the entire testimony is void. When is this true? In a situation where they all intended to testify. If, however, they did not all intend to testify, the testimony can be sustained with the remaining witnesses. How do we investigate the matter? The court would ask them if when they saw the incident they were there with the intention to witness or merely to see the incident. The court would separate anyone who says they came to testify. If a relative or someone otherwise disqualified is found among those that intended to testify, their testimony is void (even if they were not aware of each other). If all of the witnesses were valid- both those that intended to testify and those that did not but happened to see- and their testimony conforms, we would rule based on their testimony. RAMA:  They are not, however, able to write a document regarding the incident even if they witnessed a kinyan and the presumption of a kinyan is that it should be writing, because the party did not call them for that purpose. (Teshuvos HaRashba) (and see above Siman 39, Seif 5) There are those that say that even if they intended to see in order to witnesses they would not be disqualified unless they came to court and actually testified because two elements are required: intention to see for the sake of testifying and actually coming to court and testifying. RAMA: If a document contains the signature of a disqualified witness, thereby voiding the entire testimony, the valid witnesses may still testify by themselves in front of the court if they are reminded of the testimony by viewing the document. The court would then document their testimony and it would be considered a formal document (Rosh). A public regulation that has the signature of a disqualified witness or a document that contains the signature of a party, is still valid with other witnesses because these individuals did not have the intention of testifying. (Rivash) (See later 45:12-13). If the plaintiff called valid witnesses and relatives or those otherwise disqualified were standing there, the testimony of the valid witnesses would not be disqualified even if the disqualified witnesses had the intention to testify and actually testified. Similarly, when a party is in need of testimony and puts a cherem on those that know testimony to come and testify and both valid and disqualified witnesses testify, the testimony of the valid witnesses would not be void because the party’s intention was only for those that are capable of testifying.",

Therefore, if two people are partners in land and a third party attempts to remove the land from one of the partners by claiming that the individual who sold the land to them had originally stolen it from him, the other partner may not testify on behalf of his partner to disqualify the plaintiff’s witnesses. His testimony would not even help for his partner’s portion unless he removed himself from the field and they made a kinyan to give his portion to this partner. If the kinyan was not done until after the third party comes, it would still be valid. The testifying partner must accept that if his creditor were to come and collect from the partner that he would pay the partner the value of the taken land. He should make a condition that if a third party were to come to claim the land based on other claims, such as saying it was stolen from him or something similar, then he would not indemnify his partner.

If Reuven stole a garment or field from Shimon, and Yehuda brought a claim against Reuven saying that this field or garment is his, Shimon would not be able to testify that this is not Yehuda’s field or garment because Shimon just wants the field or garment to remain in Reuven’s possession because it might be easier to remove it from Reuven’s possession than it would be to remove it from Yehuda’s possession. Similarly, if Reuven sold or bequeathed the stolen field to Levi and Yehuda brings a claim against Levi, Shimon cannot testify that it does not belong to Yehuda. If Shimon sold the stolen garment to Levi, Shimon gave up on reclaiming it and Yehuda brings a claim against Levi, Shimon may testify that it is not Yehuda’s if Reuven had died because this garment will never go back to Shimon since the buyer already acquired it with the giving up of hope and the transfer of possession and Reuven the thief had died, so there is no one to collect the money from. If, however, Reuven was still alive, Shimon may not even testify on the garment because there is a benefit to him for the garment not to go to Yehuda so that he can bring a proof that Reuven stole it and Reuven will have to pay. Similarly, if the garment was in the possession of Reuven’s inheritors, Shimon may not testify because it will eventually go back to Shimon if the inheritors can maintain possession. The same applies to anything similar. Even in a case where Reuven died, Shimon may only testify if the sale was unsecured. If, however, the sale was secured, Reuven’s estate would be liable and thus Shimon has a stake in the testimony. Now that the rabbis have instituted that a creditor may even collect from a moveable item, a victim of theft may not even testify in a case where the thief died and the sale was unsecured because the victim still has a stake in the testimony. RAMA: This all applies only where Shimon wants to testify that the field or garment does not belong to Yehuda. If, however, he wants to testify that it belongs to Reuven, he may testify in every case because once he confesses that it belongs to Reuven he can no longer bring a claim that it is his. Thus, he does not have a stake in the testimony. (Tur)",

But the borrower used a kinyan sudar to obligate himself a maneh to the lender, [the witnesses] write a deed and give it to the lender even without an explicit instruction from the borrower, because it is assumed that a kinyan will be written down. Even if much time has passed before the lender approaches the witnesses and asks them to write him a deed, they may write it and give it to him, and they do not need to worry that the borrower has already repaid the debt, as long as they specifically note the time of the kinyan, or write, \"We delayed in writing this document.\" Even if the borrower dies before writing the deed, and even if the due date of the debt has passed, they may write the deed after his death. Similarly if the lender died and his heirs come to the witnesses to write a deed for them, they may write it. There are those who differ and say that if this happens after 30 days [for a debt with no specified due date], they should not write a deed, and if there is a due date specified, they should not write a deed after that date, lest the borrower has already repaid. RAMA: If the borrower did not give explicit instructions to write and hand over a deed to the lender, but the witnesses did so anyway, it is worth no more than a ledger entry (Teshuvas Rashb\"a 1:211). Nonetheless, some say that if the deed was written, it is admissible evidence. See above, chapter 46, paragraph 10. This that we require explicit instructions from the borrower only applies when he is obligating himself in a debt, but if he is forgiving a debt owed to him, or releasing someone of the obligation to pay him, there is no need for this.

The Laws of One Who Lost His Loan Document or Had It Erased, 4 Seifim: If a lender’s loan document is deteriorating and will ultimately be erased, he may arrange for witnesses and go to a court who will verify the document. RAMA: There are those that say that even if the document was completely erased the witnesses may testify since they know what is written in it. (Tur, in the name of the Rambam [the Rashbam] and Nikutei Yosef, Get Pashut). Witnesses testifying on a document may testify even if not in the presence of the parties. (Rabbeinu Yerucham in the name of the Rashbah). The witnesses on the document themselves, however, may not write another document for the lender. They may, however, come to court and the court will verify the document. How do they verify this document? They draft another document that says, “we, the court of so and so, so and so and so and so, had produced in front of us by so and so a document that was erased and had such and such date with so and so and so and so as witnesses.” If the court wrote that they processed the witnesses’ testimony and the testimony conformed, the lender can collect with this document that they wrote for him and he would not need any other verification. If the court did not write this language, the lender would need to bring an additional proof on the original witnesses until their testimony is verified. (Until here is the opinion of the Rambam)RAMA: If the witnesses are not verified, it is as if the lender produced an unverified document.(HaMagid, Chapter 23). There are those that say that it must state in the verification that they tore up the original document because otherwise we are concerned that the lender will go to another court who will process another verification for him and then he can collect and recollect. With respect to a gift document that was erased, however, we would write another document even though the first has not been torn up. RAMA: We would use the original date and not the date the court is writing the new document on (Beis Yosef in the name of Tosefos). In a case where the gift was secured or in a case of a transaction document, however, the court must tear up the original document or write in the second document that this document is not intended to allow for collection from properties sold to a third party or to collect from unsold properties, but simply to enable this particular field to remain in the hand of the gift-recipient or the buyer and prevent the gift-giver or seller from reclaiming it.",

If one had a document and misplaced it and comes to court to have the document replaced, we would not write it, even if he brought the witnesses from the original document who testify that they wrote the document and gave it to him. Therefore, a court should not duplicate any document unless they see a particular need for it such as the case of an erased document. If the court wrote the outline of a document for someone and that person comes to court with it, the court would not collect based on that document until he produces the substance of the document unless there was a written reason as to why they made another document, such as because the previous document was erased or something similar and the witnesses knew the document was lost. If, however, the witnesses did not know it was lost, they would not write another document for him. Even if there are witnesses that a document was misplaced, we would not write another document because we are concerned the lender will find it unless there are witnesses testifying that the document was burnt. RAMA: This is only true with regards to loan documents. With respect to unsecured transactional documents, however, we would write another document if the original was lost. We do not, however, duplicate a document for no purpose (Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 68, Seif 16, 21, 23, 24). In the case of a will that contains gifts to many, where one person comes to court and asks that they document his particular gift, we would write it for him because such a document would not work to collect money with because it is not a formal document and the orphans can claim they paid it back (Teshuvos HaRashbah, Siman 978 and Teshuvos HaRamban, Siman 83). We would, however, write a new document if the original document was in the hands of a third party who misplaced it because there is no concern the lender may find it considering it was not in his possession (Teshuvos HaRashbah, Siman 978 and see below 253 and see there Seif 2). If the borrower was overseas, and the lender is concerned taking the document because he is afraid he may lose it on the road, he may come to court who will write another document and the lender will leave the original document in the court in his city. The court in the borrower’s city would inform the court in the lender’s city once the loan has been paid back and the court would tear up the original document in their possession.  If the duplicate document was misplaced while he was traveling to the borrower and witnesses are aware of the loss, they would go in front of court and testify that it was misplaced and they would return the document in their possession. RAMA: (Tur) Any document that is duplicated is written letter for letter from the original. They would write on it that it is a duplicate. A court is not required for the duplication. Even two witnesses are able to duplicate (and even if they are related to one another). (Rivash, Siman 413) (This is a hosafah from the Sm\"a and it is not correct what is written in Siman 100, 18)",

If one had a documented debt owed by his counterparty and he lost the document but the witnesses are accessible, and the borrower claims he paid back, the borrower would be believed with a heses oath even if a kinyan was made. The borrower is believed with a heses oath to say he paid back even if the payment deadline had not passed because the lender no longer possesses the document and we are concerned that the borrower paid back, which is why the document was ripped up or burnt. Even if a third party produced the document and the borrower claims he had dropped it after paying back the loan, he would be believed with a heses oath and would be exempt from paying, even if  the deadline for payment had not yet passed, because once the lender no longer has the document we do not apply the principle that a person does not pay back before the deadline.

The appropriate way to draft a document is to pay attention to the vov’s and zayin’s so that they are not stuffed between words lest a party forge the document and add a vav or zayin. The letters should not be far apart from one another lest a party erase one letter like a hey or ches and leave the leg in place of a vov. One must be careful with anything similar in any other language and any other script (Tur). Therefore, a scribe must be careful when writing a document to have the letters looks similar to each other and the writing should be straight and equal in all aspects so that the letters are not too far apart from each other. The scribe should not press the writing together too much nor should he press in one area and give space in another area. Therefore, witnesses are not permitted to sign until they investigate all the words of the document well and when the document is produced in front of the judge, the judge must investigate all the words and compare each letter.

If, however, they remember the date of the kinyan and are writing it, then they should write the locale where the kinyan took place, because if they were to write the place where it was written, they would be found to be fraudsters and will be disqualified. When they write the place of documentation, they write, “this is what so and so told us and we wrote it in such and such place.” If, however, they are writing the place where the testimony was handed over, they write “so and so told us” or “we made a kinyan from so and so in such and such place and we wrote and signed it and handed it over to so and so.”",

This is in fact the widespread custom in these countries. The rationale seems to me to be that we hold that a solo expert has the status of three laymen with respect to the rabbinical verification of documents and is therefore considered a court as was explained earlier in Siman 25. Although we do not have expert individuals today, with respect to verification of documents, however, we can rely on this. This is what seems to me to be the reasoning behind the custom.",

We do not verify a document from other documents except from two documents of two fields where the owners consumed a public consumption for three years without any fear or trepidation from any claim in the same manner that all field-owners consume their fields or from two kesubos, so long as the documents are produced from a third party and not from this individual who is looking to verify the document because he may have forged all of them. (We would not verify the documents if they were produced from the party’s hand, even if both documents were verified. (Tur; Beis Yosef in the name of Rashi) There are those that disagree. (R\"an according to the opinion of the Rambam)  Similarly, we can verify a document from a single document that was protested against- (there are those that say that even if no one protested, but the document was simply verified as we have later in seif 37)- and was affirmed in court just as we verify from documents of two fields or two kesubos. RAMA: There are those that say we can verify a document from a book that the witness wrote but not from a letter that he wrote.

If one signed on a document and comes to court to testify on his own handwriting and he recognizes his signature with certainty but does not remember the testimony at all and he cannot recall that this party ever borrowed from this one, he is prohibited from testifying on this handwriting that is in this court because a person does not testify that this is his handwriting but that this party owed that party the actual money in the document. The handwriting is merely a form of reminding him of the incident, but if he does not remember he cannot testify. Thus, if a document was produced in court and witnesses come and say this is our handwriting but we never knew of such testimony and we have no recollection that this party borrowed from or sold to the other, the document would not be verified and the witnesses have a status of the deaf until they recall their testimony. Any judge who does not judge accordingly does not know between his right and left when it comes to monetary law. If, however, the witness’ handwriting was produced from another place or there were other witnesses that testified that this was their handwriting, we would verify the document and we would not pay attention to the words of the witnesses that say we don’t recall the testimony because the document is being verified without their words. This is the reason we are able to verify all documents and we do not require to bring the witnesses and ask them if they remember the testimony or not because even if they were to come and say we don’t remember the incident, we would not listen to them since we can verify the document without their words. These were the words of the Rambam. There are those that disagree and say that even if they do not recall that the party borrowed or that they ever signed on this document and we do not have their handwriting from any other source, since they are testifying that this is their handwriting, we would verify the document based on their words. Under this approach, when the witnesses themselves are coming to testify that this is their handwriting, if they forgot the loan and do not remember signing this document at all, we would require two witnesses on each signature. Therefore, we would need each witnesses to testify on his signature and on his co-witness’ signature or a third party should join them and testify on both their handwriting in order to have two witnesses on each signature. RAMA: We do not require a witness to remember his testimony except in a case of a solo witness or with two witnesses when it comes to verifying the document. With respect to two witnesses that sign on the document, however, if they did not remember the incident at all and the document was not written as was instituted, there would still be a testimony of witnesses (Mahar\"iv, Siman 94; Hagahot Mordechai, Kesuvos) and if the document was verified we would follow whatever is written in it. Although this document does not have the status of a complete document, it is considered a document with respect to not having the testimony considered as written testimony as was explained above in 28:12. (Teshuvos Rashba, Siman 1000; Rabbeinu Tam) There are those that disagree as was explained above in the beginning of 39:3.",

If there were witnesses that this was the deceased’s handwriting or their handwriting was produced from another document that was called into question and later affirmed in court, we would not tear up the document. There are those that say that we do not require the document to have been called into question because it suffices that it was affirmed in court, even if the document was not called into question. RAMA: This is all where the witnesses have already died. If, however, the witnesses were alive and two other witnesses come to disqualify them and say that the witnesses were disqualified, even the document itself would be disqualified notwithstanding the fact that their signature has been produced from another source. (R\"an; and the Tur in the name of Tosefos) There are those that disagree and say the document is valid. (Ibid., in the name of his father, the Rosh) This, that the latter witnesses are not believed where the handwriting of the document witnesses is produced from another source, does not mean that the document is valid to collect with. Rather, if a party were to grab movable items on the basis of it, we would not take it away from him. (Tur in the name of Rashi; the Rosh) If the witness’ handwriting was not produced from another source, and the witnesses said this is our handwriting but within kidei dibur they said we were forced by threat of life, we were minors, we were disqualified due to familial relationship and we are no longer related, he nullified the document in front of us or the document had a condition that we did not see fulfilled, the witnesses are believed. Even if one witness says there was no condition and the other says there was a condition and it was not fulfilled, the second witness is believed and only one witness remains. If the document says, “we the witnesses testify that there is nothing omitted from the document,” they cannot say there was a condition because witnesses cannot re-testify. If they say, however, that this that they said that there was no omission was not meant to nullify any condition but just that nothing was omitted from actual sale, they would be believed. (Tur) Similarly, they may explain their words in the document in any manner that does not contradict their words. (Nimukei Yosef) If, however, the witnesses said they were forced via monetary threat, the document was given on trust or they were disqualified due to sin, they would not be believed even if they’re claiming they subsequently repented. Although they are not believed to void the document, they are believed with respect to themselves and they would be obligated to pay the borrower the loss they caused him by signing. If they said that at the time they signed that they were unaware that the document was given on trust and it later became clear to them that it was, they would be believed. If their handwriting was produced from another source or there are witnesses that this is their handwriting, they would not be believed regarding anything they say to void the document except if they said the party nullified the document in front of us.",

He can write everything that is contained in the document: the names of the borrower and lender and the description of the money. He must leave the place for the date blank so that the document will not be predated. With respect to a document that was written for one loan and was paid back, however, one cannot re-borrow with it even if it was all on the same day and was therefore not predated because once the lien is waived one cannot re-borrow with the document. If the borrower paid back a portion of the loan, he cannot use the same document to re-borrow that portion because that lien on that portion was already waived. RAMA: There are those that say that concept of the lien being waived only applies for the original kinyan. Thus, if the borrower made a second kinyan, he may re-borrow with the document. (Mordechai, Perek 'Kol HaGet') This applies even if they did not actually make a kinyan but the borrower simply gave the document to the lender in front of witnesses according to the view that the witnesses of transfer are primary even with respect to ordinary documents. (Mordechai Perek 'HaKotev') (See later Siman 51.",

In the case of a loan document without a kinyan, they must also know the name of the lender. If the witnesses do not recognize any of the foregoing, even a woman or relative would be believed to say that this is the individual's name. In a case where they relied on a woman or relative and it turns out the witnesses erred, we would believe this error occurred where the witness is a scholar (because it is not the practice of scholars to investigate the specifics) (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Rashbam). There are those that say this is only true with respect to a woman because scholars are not familiar with women considering that it is not their practice to gaze at women, as will be explained in Even Haezer Siman 110. With respect to other matters, however, there is no distinction between a scholar and anyone else. The author of the Shulchan Aruch wrote in his sefer Beis Yosef that this view is in fact the primary view. Thus, it is a bewilderment that he takes the opposite approach here). With respect to other individuals who do have the practice to investigate the specifics, we would not accept them because they certainly were cautious originally and now they are retracting and lying. RAMA: The same applies with other errors by the scribe where it is obvious that there was an error, and the document would be valid. We say that that the scribe erred just as we say with respect to the lack of a lien in a document (The Rosh Klal 58, Siman 32) (as was explained above in the beginning of Siman 39.)",

    "text_en": "7. If two individuals in the city both had the name Yosef ben Shimon, neither of them can produce a document against the other if the document contains a kinyan because the defendant can say that this document that you are producing against me is mine and I returned it to you when you paid me back for the money you owed me. RAMA: The Mecahber’s words contradict each other because there is no distinction between a document with a kinyan and one without if the reasoning for the foregoing is that one can say this document is mine and I returned it to you. There are those, however, that explain the reasoning that one cannot produce a document against the other (to be used) because we write documents for a borrower even if not in the presence of the lender so we are concerned that the party that produced it is the borrower. This concern would only apply to a document that contains a kinyan as we said above at the end of Siman 39. That is why the Mechaber wrote that this only applies for a document that contains a kinyan, Thus, his words are contradictory). A third party cannot produce a document on either of them because each one can say it was not written against me but against the other, unless the document’s witnesses themselves come and say that this is the document we testified on and this is the party that we testified was involved in the loan. If other witnesses testify in that way, the loan has the status of a verbal loan. If one of the Yosef ben Shimons was a minor on the date of the document, we would collect from the other. What is the way to rectify this issue? They should write the names of their grandfathers. If their grandfathers also had the same name, they should write some other sign. RAMA: There are those that say that if they are from different cities then they can produce a document against each other because they must write the name of the borrower’s city or the lender’s city in the document. (Tur, in the name of Rabbeinu Yeshayah) There are those that say that we do not write the name of the city in the document (Rambam, Perek 17; Tur, Siman 61) and this is in fact the custom. However, if they are from two different cities and they wrote the name of the city of one of them, this is certainly no worse than a sign and there is no room for error. This is what appears correct to me. If there are two Yosef ben Shimons in one city and one of their fathers had died and in the document it says yv’s, shli’t or nr’v like we write for someone who is alive and the witnesses wrote “Yosef ben Shimon shli’ta told us” that would qualify as a sign. If, however, the document says, “I, Yosef ben Shimon shli’t” or something similar, “borrowed from so and so…” and the witnesses signed below, that would not qualify as a sign because perhaps the second Yosef ben Shimon wrote this with trickery and the witnesses did not pick up on it because they are not signing on everything in the document. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba) If, however, they were to produce a document against a third party, that third party would not be able to say 'I did not owe you but instead owed the other person who has the same name as you', because we assume that the person who produced the document is the rightful owner of the document. RAMA: If, however, Yosef ben Shimon did not produce the document, he would not be able to take away money from the borrower (Nimukei Yosef in the name of the Ritva), even if the borrower confesses that he owes one of them, unless the two Yosef ben Shimons were to write a power-of-attorney to each other.  If the borrower is in possession of a receipt from one of them, neither of them can make a claim against the borrower because the borrower can tell each one that you wrote this receipt for me. If, however, they were to write a power-of-attorney to each other, one of them would be able to collect because the borrower admits that he only paid one back. If the borrower claims he paid back both of them but only demanded one receipt because it would suffice to show that receipt to whichever one comes to him to claim the loan, the claim would be valid and the power-of-attorney would not be effective.",

Similarly, where the two are partners, the lender cannot claim half of the land on the basis of the fact that he is owed that amount in either instance because a debtor’s properties are only mortgaged as a co-signer to the loan and a co-signer is only indebted to the lender in an instance where the lender can claim from the borrower himself.

If the lender says he does not have the document in his possession right now but it is in another city and he will write a receipt, there are those that say that we do not listen to him because the document is in existence so the borrower does not have to pay back until the lender returns the document. RAMA: All the more so would the borrower not be required to pay back until the document is returned in a case where the lender has the document in his possession and does not want to return it. Even if the borrower swore to pay back he would be exempt from complying with the oath. (Teshuvos Rashba, Aleph 110) If the lender says to pay him back first and then he will return the document and the borrower says to first return the document and then he’ll pay him, the borrower is in the right. (Ibid., and in Siman 113) It seems to me that if the lender does not trust the borrower he may give the document to a third party until the repayment has been completed. If one owes another a maneh in a document and confesses to 50 but has a claim on the other 50 and the possessor of the document says to give him the 50 the borrower admits to and he will bring a proof for the other 50 and the defendant says that he is not paying anything back until the lender returns the document, if the plaintiff has the ability to bring his proofs now and proceed with the case with the defendant, (See above Siman 24) then the defendant is in the right. If, however, it is impossible for the lender to bring his proofs now or be judged now, as determined by the court, and there is no trickery involved or where the court needs to be patient in ruling, the plaintiff is in the right and the borrower must pay what he admits to immediately and the lender will provide a receipt. (Ibid., Siman תתק\"ל) If a document states that it shall remain in force so long as it has not been torn up with a tear of the court and does not contain a confirmation of repayment on the document, a receipt would still be effective. (Maharik, Shoresh 89) When writing a receipt, if they recall the date of the document, they would write “receipt on the document dated such and such.” If they do not recall the date, they would simply write “on the document whose amount was such and such” and they would not write a date on the receipt lest the witnesses postdated the date of the loan in the document, which may result in the date of receipt preceding the date of the document and the lender will produce the later loan document and collect with it. Therefore, witnesses should not write a date in the receipt unless they remember the date of the loan. A receipt that simply says, “so and so paid back so and so” nullifies that any document that the lender has against the borrower. RAMA: Similarly, if a borrower has witnesses that so and so has a repaid document in his possession, such so and so would not be able to produce a document against the borrower and say that it was a different document that was paid back. Rather, all of this lender’s documents have the status of being repaid. (the Rosh in his Teshuvos, Klal 18, Siman 19)",

The Laws of One Who Paid Back a Portion of His Debt and One Who Gives His Document to a Third Party, 2 Seifim: (The words of the Rambam, Perek 11 מה' מכירה)One who paid back a portion of his debt and gave the document to a third party and said “if I do not pay you back by such and such date, give the lender the document” and the borrower did not pay at that time, the third party should not give over the document because this is an asmachta, which is not a valid kinyan. [Ed. Note: An Asmachta is a conditional commitment or promise that a person makes, but actually has no intention of keeping. The agreement is not considered binding, and the commitment is considered null and void.] If they made a kinyan on it in a prestigious court, the party would acquire the document, so long as his rights were being held by the court and an unforeseen occurrence did not occur. How so? If the court is holding on to his document or receipt and they made a kinyan from him that if he does not come by such and such date, then it should be given to his adversary, and the day comes and he does not show up, the court would give it. If he was held up by a river or by a sickness, they would not give it. The same applies to anything similar, so long as it was in a prestigious court. RAMA: There are those that say that we do not require the court to hold on to his document if they have a made a kinyan in a prestigious court, which is three individuals who are experts in the laws of asmachta.

(Beis Yosef in the name of Rashba) If the court was unaware and they took all the money from the borrower and it subsequently became known that the third party returned the document illegally, the third party is exempt because it is an indirect damage.

(Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba) Even if the timeframe given to hand over the document has passed and the third party has not given the document, he still is a third party and he is believed. The third party is believed even if one of the parties contradicts him and says he never made him a third party. The third party is even believed where both parties contradict him so long as there is no dispute between the parties and the third party regarding the amount of money in his possession, because otherwise the third party would have a stake in the matter and would not be believed RAMA: In a case where the third party does not have a migu. If, however, the third party has a migu, he is believed. (Mordechai, Perek 'HaChovel') [Ed. Note: A migu is a reason that a claim that would otherwise be rejected by a Jewish civil court should be accepted based on the fact that the litigant could have prevailed in the case based on a different claim were he disposed to lie. To be effective, the logic underlying the migu must be impeccable and there are a variety of cases in which the Migu argument is invalid.] The parties may force him to swear, even with an uncertain claim. (Hagahos Mordechai, Gitin) If the third party had the document, produced it in court and says it was paid back, he would be believed even if the document was verified because had he wanted he could have burnt or torn the document. Similarly, if the third party died and a writing was discovered in the third party’s possession saying the document that he had was paid back, the document is considered paid back even if there are no witnesses on the writing. (See later Siman 65 with respect to these laws). If, however, a writing was produced from the lender’s possession saying that so and so’s document was paid back, it is treated as a joke, even if it was written in the lender’s handwriting. (The plaintiff must pay the expenses of the third party). (Hagahos Mordechai)",

RAMA: If the lender does not contradict the messengership, but the third party does not want to accept it and the item remains in the possession of the messenger, the messenger does not have the status of a third party but that of a messenger and he must return the item to the party that gave it. (Beis Yosef in the name of Teshuvos HaRashba) The third party must always comply with the terms of the handing-over, even if one of the parties later has a claim on it. How so? If Reuven agreed with Shimon, who owed him money, on a (payback) date and deposited the document with Levi on the condition that if Shimon does not pay back by a certain date then Levi will return the document and be able to collect everything in one shot and Shimon did not pay by the prescribed time, Levi must return the document even if he knows that Shimon has claims on this because he is not a judge- just a third party. Therefore, he must return the document to Reuven and before he produces it he should describe in front of witnesses how the document came to him and what the conditions were. The witnesses will write and sign the details and provide it to the third party who will give it to Shimon, and Shimon can now claim what he wants.

The lender may collect without an oath if the document contains a believability clause. If the borrower later brings a claim that the lender took the money illegally, the lender would take a heses oath and be exempt. If the document does not contain a believability clause, the lender may only collect with an oath. If the borrower did not personally pay back but sent the money via a messenger, the messenger is required to pay back the borrower that sent him, whether the borrower had said to take the document  (And see later Siman 130, Seif 5)and then give the money or give the money and then take the document. (Ibid.) RAMA: There are those that say that since the messenger is required to pay, the lender cannot hold on to the money if he says the borrower owes him for something else, unless the lender claims the messenger gave it to him for that other debt. There are those that disagree and hold that the lender may claim the borrower owes him for something else in all cases. (Mordechai, Perek 'HaKotev Shtei Hedeyot') Similarly, if one gave a deposit to another, and the guardian says that the deposited item belongs to a third party who owes the guardian money and the guardian claims that such third party gave the depositor the item as a messenger, the guardian has the right to claim up to the value of the item with a migu that he returned the item, notwithstanding the fact that the depositor will need to reimburse the third party. If, however, he says that the depositor did not mention the third party and simply deposited the item with him but the guardian claims that the item really belongs to the third party, the guardian cannot hold on to the item since we cannot prove that the third party owed the guardian money. (Rivash, Siman 293) There are those that say this is only where the item came to the guardian as a deposit. If, however, he grabbed it from the depositor and he has a migu, the guardian can say that the owner of the item owed him money and the depositor would be liable to pay the owner because he was negligent. (Beis Yosef, end of Siman 84 in the name of the Ritva; and the Ritva writes more in Perek HaKotev, see there) If, however, the borrower did not mention that the messenger should take the document, the messenger would be exempt  since the borrower did not tell the messenger to give the money in front of witnesses.

    "text_en": "1. The Laws of a Lien on Movable Items Via Real Property and the Laws of a Lien On an Item That Has Not Yet Come Into Existence, 12 Seifim: If one comes to collect a debt from the borrower and the borrower does not have the funds corresponding to the entire debt, the borrower may collect from real property that the borrower had at the time he borrowed from this lender, which he later sold or gave away. With respect to real property that the borrower purchased after he borrowed from this lender that he later sold or gave away, however, the lender may not collect such land. If the document states that the borrower is mortgaging properties that he has already purchased and those that he will purchase in the future, the lender may also collect from them. There is no security, however, on movable items, even those that the borrower had at the time he borrowed, which for the time being he has sold or given away, and the lender may not collect from them. If the document states, “the borrower is mortgaging the movable items that the borrower has via his real property and it is not an asmachta nor is it the outline of the document”- see later Simans 113 and 202 – then the lender may collect from movable items that he had at the time he borrowed just as the lender may collect from the real property. If the document states, “the borrower is mortgaging the movable items via the real property that he currently owns and that he will own in the future and it is not an asmachta nor is it the outline of the document,” the lender may even collect movable items that the borrower purchased subsequent to the loan which he later sold or gave away just as he may collect from real property. This is all the law under the Talmud. Today, although we have the custom to write in all documents that the borrower is mortgaging movable items via real property, the custom is not to collect from movable times which the borrower sold, gave away or gave as collateral because of a “market regulation.” Even under this custom, if the borrower had a loan document on a third party which he sold, the lender may collect from that loan because the “market regulation” is not applicable considering this is an uncommon case. Similarly, if the borrower gave away all his properties to a third party and did not retain anything for himself, it is clear circumstantial evidence that he did it just to avoid the debt and the “market regulation” is inapplicable. See later 99:6.",

If the giver explicitly conditioned to support the recipient on the giver’s table and the recipient does not want to eat with him, the giver only is required to give him based on the cost of having the recipient eat in the giver’s home. RAMA: If, however, the hold-up is not coming from the one being supported but from the obligated party, the obligated party must give the complete cost of the food. (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Ritva) If the recipient gets sick, the giver does not have to pay his medical expenses and must only pay the value of the food that the recipient received while healthy. (Beis Yosef, end of Siman 207 in the name of the Ritva, Perek 'HaNoseh') There are those that say that where one simply agrees to support his friend, the language implies he will support him his entire lifetime or so long as he needs it. (R\"an, Perek Mi She'Achazu; Beis Yosef in the Tur Even HaEzer Siman 114 inb the name of the Rashba) There are those that say that if one simply agrees to support the other or provide him with 100 gold coins for the year, he will be exempt from just one year of his agreement. (Teshuvos HaRosh 26, Siman 24) If one accepts to support his friend based on his prestige, the court will evaluate what the recipient was accustomed to prior to the obligation. (Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 75; Tur Siman 207) Dress is not included in the category of food unless the giver says he will feed and support because clothing is included in support. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba) If one writes to his friend that he will support him for a set amount of time or give him 100 dinar and he supported him a little bit but then stopped, the giver does not need to provide 100 dinar. Rather, he must reimburse for the difference between the value for the food given and 100 dinar, but no more than 100 dinar, because he certainly did not intend to give 100 dinar unless he did not provide any support. (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Rashba) If Reuven accepts on himself to support Shimon and his wife and began supporting them and Shimon’s wife died, Reuven is exempt from providing her support. Even if Reuven had set up a set amount for the support of Shimon’s wife, he is still exempt from that portion. (Teshuvos HaRashba)",

If one obligates himself for a matter that is not yet in existence or is not available to him, he is still obligated notwithstanding the fact that one cannot make a kinyan on a matter not yet in existence because that is only with respect to a kinyan made in the language of a sale or gift. Even where one writes a lien on a field, mortgages all of his properties or even gives it as a collateral, it is of no effect. When one uses a language of being obligated however, such as where he says “you are my witnesses that I am obligated to so and so, such and such,” he would be obligated, so long as they made a kinyan from him. If Reuven produces a document with a kinyan against Shimon which says, “because I gave him 100 gold coins and mortgaged all my properties for him to collect from,”( but did not obligate himself personally) (Beis Yosef) and Shimon claims that at the time the document was written against him he did not have the money and a person cannot make a kinyan on something not yet in existence and the gold coins in the document are coins that people generally transact with, the coins cannot be acquired via chalipin [barter]. If that country does not generally transact with those gold coins, they could be acquired via chalipin  - see later 211:6- but they must have been in Shimon’s possession at the time of the kinyan. If it is unknown whether it was in his possession, the plaintiff has the burden of proof. RAMA: If the plaintiff claims with certainty that it was in the defendant’s possession and the defendant denies it, the defendant must swear. (Tur, in the name of the R\"if) The defendant is believed to say he gave it already it with a migu that he could have said it was not in his possession at the time of the loan. However, this is all according to the reasoning of the R\"if and some others. Many others, however, disagree with this and hold that anyone who says 'I gave so and so, such and such', is an admission by a party and has the status of 100 witnesses. We do not investigate how it was given because once he was confessed we assume he gave it in an effective manner and the recipient would acquire it.

Rema: Any document in which the witnesses did not sign with the intent of delivering it to the parties, but merely as a memorandum, is not considered a valid shtar. Similarly, a document that was never meant to be written in the first place — and where it’s possible that the witnesses made a mistake — is not judged based on that document (Responsa of the Rashba, section 1011), for it is considered as if it were transmitted orally, as explained above in section 28, paragraphs 11 and 12.

If there was such a craftsman in the alleyway and no one objected, or if there was a bathhouse, store or mill and another member came and made another one opposite the existing one, the current owner cannot stop him and say he is cutting of his livelihood. Even if the new individual is from another alleyway, they cannot stop him because they already have that craftsman among them. There are many that say that in the case of a courtyard or an alleyway that is not open, they would be able to object, even in such a case. The craftsman himself, however, would not be able to object and say you are cutting off my livelihood. If one who lives in another country and wants to set up a store next to this store or a bathhouse next to this bathhouse, however, the members would be able to prevent him. If he pays government taxes with them, they would not be able to stop him. There are many who say that even in such a case he has no right to enter any alleyway that has people from his trade, because a member of that trade has the right to prevent him from entering since he is from another city. In the case of another alleyway, however, he cannot object because the new individual pays taxes. The people of the city have the right to object in all cases and say we cannot sleep because of the sound of people entering, notwithstanding the fact that they already have such a craftsman. If one did not yet pay taxes and now he wants to work and will pay taxes, there are those who say his fellow craftsman can stop him until he rents a house and becomes like a member of the city. There are those that say that one who gives the “king’s gift” is not considered to have paid taxes, until he gives taxes to the ruler of this particular city that has jurisdiction over them. In all these cases, there is no distinction between a scholar and others, other than in the case of peddlers which will be discussed shorty. There are those that say that if the people of the city need the scholar’s Torah, they cannot object, even if there is another scholar in the city because “the jealousy of scholars creates an increase in wisdom.” If a scholar brings his merchandise to the city, everyone is required to refrain from selling until the scholar sells his wares. If there is a gentile who is selling, so there will be no gain to the scholar, everyone is permitted to sell. See Yoreh Deah Siman 243. If one has a business arrangement with a gentile, there are those places that rule that others are prohibited from interfering with his livelihood and doing business with that gentile, and there are some places that do not rule that way. There are those who permit another Jew to go to that gentile to lend him, do business with him, bribe him and take property from him because a gentile’s property is considered ownerless. There are those who prohibit it. Even where a Jew regularly does work with a gentile, it would be prohibited for another Jew to compete and do the work at a cheaper price. If he wants to do it, we would rebuke him. Nevertheless, if he violated and did the work we would not remove the money from him. See later Siman 227. If two individuals live together and one wants to lend with interest to a gentile, the other cannot object. The same applies to anything similar. See later 228:18.",

    "text_en": "Residents of a city can stop merchants who bring their wares to sell in the city from selling them individually as storekeepers do. If they only sold on market-days, the people of the city cannot stop them, so long as they sold in the market. They cannot knock on doors, however, even on a market-day. If they have an outstanding loan in the city, they can sell the amount needed for sustenance, even if it is not a market-day, until their debt is repaid and then they will leave. The same applies to lending with interest to gentiles, and the people of the city may stop them. They cannot stop them if they come on a market-day and lend with interest to the people who are gathered there to go to the market, however. If they have an outstanding loan in the city, they can lend until they make enough money for sustenance in order that they can collect their debts. There are those that say that this that people of a city can stop people of another city, is only is there is no loss to the consumer because they are selling just as the others in the city are selling and their merchandise is no better than those of the people in the city. If they were selling at a cheaper price or if their merchandise was better, however, in which case the consumers are benefiting, the seller-merchants cannot object, so long as the consumers are Jews. If only gentiles were benefiting, however, this would not apply. When merchants brings other merchandise that the city does not have, even though it is no cheaper or better than the existing merchandise, the people of the city cannot object. If members of the city fled to a settlement because of a concern of danger, the people in the settlement cannot stop them from making enough profit for them to live until the danger passes. Based on the small amount of commerce they are involved in, they will carry the burden of the public. If they are included in the city-tax, the members of the city cannot stop them. Similarly, if they come to expel someone from the city who does not have the right to live there, they cannot expel him until he collects his debts, and he can profit in the meantime the amount required to live. There are those who say that this that the merchant is only required to pay taxes based on his transactions is only where they are not allowing him to live there. If they are allowing him to live there completely, however, he must pay taxes as if he was a full resident or he must leave. There are those who disagree with this. If people of a city are involved in commerce in another city, it is not in their power to force them to give as much taxes as they want. Rather, we tell them give such and such amount or we object to them transacting in their cities. If people from another city come to spend in another city and not cause any gain to the people of the city, the people of the city do not have the right to object, notwithstanding the fact that the market rate will increase. All this only applies when others are coming to transact in a city that they do not live in, and that is why the members of the city have the right to object even though they are willing to pay taxes because they were not part of the tax base until now. If they want to come live in that city and pay taxes like a member of the city, however, there are those who say they have the right to do so because a person has the right to live in whatever place he wants. The original residents did not acquire the rights to the city. There are those who disagree and say that they do have the right to object, specifically in today’s age where we live under the jurisdiction of other nations and there is a fear that if there are more residents, something negative can arise from such other nations and thus one who wants to live there have the status of a “pursuer.” Everyone agrees that if the people of the city have the ability to close the doors, to have the rulers object to immigrants coming or some other way of preventing people from moving in, they have the right to do so. There are those places that have a custom to create a cherem against people coming to move there, in which case they have the power to force immigrants via cherem, but not by law. They can decree that no one may transact with those people coming to live there without permission. If the city has a Rabbi, he may make a decree on any student of his who is coming to live there. There are those who say that a cherem against immigration would not take effect on a scholar because he can live wherever he wants to. If they voided the cherem for one person and they gave him permission to live there for a set time, we do not say the entire cherem is voided and they can force him out later. If Reuven and his children lived in one settlement and made a bona-fide claim that they obtained rights, the obtainment of rights would be valid and they can object to Shimon living there. If Shimon claims with witnesses that he was afraid to object because Reuven and his children would snitch to the government, Reuven would not obtain rights. If Reuven was a snitch but his sons were not, however, they would obtain rights, because the son of a thief has the power to obtain rights. We apply the same rules with respect to obtaining rights to live as we do to obtaining rights to real property. There is an ancient custom that if one traveled from a city for 12 months and indicated that he has no intention of returning, he had lost his rights. If he did not indicate that he did not intend on returning, however, he would not lose his rights until he was away for three years. If he indicated that he had the intention of returning, he would not even lose his rights after three years. There are those who say that even where he did not indicate intention either way he would not lose his rights. If people of a city had the rights to live and they were driven out one time for the city and some of them subsequently returned and reestablished the city, the others will have no claims against him. See the end of Siman 149 with respect to someone who has obtained rights against the public with respect to a mitzvah.",

If, however, the work involves an immediate loss - e.g., he hired the workers to remove flax from the vat, or he hired a donkey to bring flutes for a funeral or for a wedding or the like - neither a worker nor a contractor may retract (a maid or a servant of the employer considered an immediate loss since the employer is not able to do the work himself, therefore he suffers a loss) unless he is held back by forces beyond his control -e.g., he became ill (him or his wife or his children) or he heard that a close relative died. (However the employer does not have to pay the full wage, but only for their work, they {the workers} have the upper hand. If the employer re-employees the workers after the circumstance is over without specifying anything, and they come back to do their job then he pays them in full and does not deduct anything. If not, then the employer deducts all the sick or unfortunate days, even though he didn't back out. The same ruling is for a teacher who fell ill, you deduct the sick days. However if the worker or teacher already received their payment then some say that he does not have to return. A teacher who backs out is considered 'immediate loss' the same applies to a scribe who accepted to write a book and backed out in the middle, is considered 'immediate loss'. Teachers are classified like other workers who need to act as is customary to start and to finish work, as explained in Siman 331. He is prohibited from doing other work while he is teaching or to stay up at night excessively or to minimize or add in food, and whoever changes has the 'lower hand' and is removed. A teacher who was hired for a set period of time has the laws of a worker. If he was hired to teach a book or half a book then he has the laws of a contractor, see Siman 33, 34 &amp; 35 regarding the laws of a teacher.) If the worker is not held back by forces beyond his control, and he retracts, the owner may hire others on their account or deceive them. (If he found other workers to hire and he deceived the original workers then he has to pay them based on his last agreement.) What is meant by deceiving them? He tells them: \"I agreed to pay you a sela; take two so that you will complete your work.\" Afterwards, he is not required to give them anything more than he originally agreed. Moreover, even if he gave them two, he can compel them to return the additional amount. (A volunteer can back out, even if it causes 'immediate loss'.)",

It is clear that his intent was to help her steal from her father-in-law.

Similarly, if the thief hid the stolen item and he needed to leave the city but was unable to move the stolen item so he sent another person to bring the stolen item to him, the agent would be liable because he is the primary thief given that he knew it was stolen. If one directs another what to seal or sends him to steal, the sender is not liable because there is no agency when it comes to a sin. If the agent is not a party capable of being liable, however, there are those who say the sender is liable.

    "text_en": "Paragraph 8- Similarly, if a king becomes angry with one of his servants or assistants from his jurisdiction and he took his field or courtyard, it is not robbery and one is permitted to derive benefit from him. If one purchases it from the king, it belongs to him and the owner cannot remove it from him. If the king took a field or courtyard from one of his citizens not in compliance with the laws he set up, he is a robber and if one purchases it from him, the owner may remove him from the property. The general rule is that any general law that the king sets up for everyone, and not just for one person, is not robbery, and if anyone takes property from one person not known to comply with the laws that are not know to all, then it is robbery. If the law was set for just one industry, such as were he made a law that a certain item can be loaned with interest, there are those who say we do not apply the principle of the law of the land is the law because it was not set for everyone. There are those who say we do not apply the principle of the law of the land is the law except with regards to taxes and property-taxes because the king decrees that people can only live on his lands in this fashion. With respect to other matters, however, we would not apply such a principle. There are those who disagree and hold we apply the principle that the law of the land is the law on all matters. Thus, if one lends on collateral, he may sell the collateral after a year because that is the law of the land. This is the primary view, as was discussed above in 356:7.",

If one marries a woman in a place where they judge with secular law, and his wife dies, the wife’s father or other inheritors cannot say that anyone who gets married does so with the understanding that they will follow local custom and that any matter should be litigated in secular courts so that if she were to die her husband would not inherit her or something similar.

However, if the beit din sees a necessity for a preventative measure, it has the authority to institue whatever punishment they see fit (ibid., from the Responsa of the Natronai Gaon), as explained above in Siman 2. This regards those instances involving capital punishment which necessitates a beit din. Cases in which the death penalty can be implemented even without a beit din, are still judged in our days, as will be explained (ibid.). One who pursuses his fellow in order to kill him, and was warned, and continued in his pursuit: Even if the pursuer was a minor, every Jew is commanded to save the pursed, even at the cost of one maiming one of the pursuer's limbs. If it is impossible to save the pursued without killing the pursuer outright, then the pursuer should indeed be killed, even though he has not yet performed the act. Rema: (Tur 67) One who \"tunnels [into a house] in order steal\" has this rule of pursuer applied to him, however if it is understood that his only intent is monetary gain, and that he would not kill the owner in a confrontation, then it is forbidden to kill him. See further in the Tur in this paragraph regarding one who endangers the public, such as a Jew who engages in forgery in a land where the authorities take a strict approach to such action, such a person constitutes a \"pursuer\" and it is permitted to turn him over to the authorities (Nimukei Maharam MiRizburg), as explained above in 388:12.",
